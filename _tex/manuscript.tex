  clearly lateralized
\end{itemize}

\section{Data on Lymphatic Progression
Patterns}\label{data-on-lymphatic-progression-patterns}

We have collected a detailed dataset of patients with newly diagnosed
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. It reports the involvement of
every patient individually and per lymph node level in tabular form, in
addition to other clinico-pathological information such as age,
T-category, and HPV p16 status.

Their patient records have been collected at four different institutions
and a brief overview over some of their patients' characteristics are
shown in table~\ref{tbl-data-overview}. Note that the data from the
Inselspital Bern and the Centre Léon Bérard only consists of patients
treated with some form of neck dissection. Since this treatment is more
commonly chosen for early T-category patients, they also make up a
larger portion of the respective dataset.

\subsection{Contralateral Involvement Prevalence}\label{sec-data-strat}

These datasets allow us to investigate correlations between the
involvement of individual LNLs, or between risk factors and patterns of
involvement. In figure~\ref{fig-data-strat}, we have plotted the
prevalence of each contralateral LNL's involvement, stratified by
T-category, ipsilateral number of involved LNLs, and whether the tumor
extended over the mid-sagittal line. A similar but more complete
stratification is also tabulated in the appendix in
table~\ref{tbl-data-strat}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\centering{

\includegraphics{manuscript_files/figure-latex/data-fig-data-strat-output-1.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-data-strat}Contralateral involvement stratified by
T-category (left panel), the number of metastatic LNLs ipsilaterally
(center panel), and whether the primary tumor extended over the
mid-sagittal line or was clearly lateralized (right panel).}

\end{figure}%

\textsubscript{Source:
\href{https://rmnldwg.github.io/bilateral-paper/manuscript-preview.html}{Article
Notebook}}

The left panel in figure~\ref{fig-data-strat} indicates that T-category
is correlated with contralateral involvement (as it is with overal
involvement). This is simply because T-category may on average be
considered a surrogate for the time between onset of disease and
diagnosis. I.e., a patient with a T4 tumor was -- on average --
diagnosed later than a patient with a T1 tumor. Thus, the former did
have more time to develop metastases.

Similarly, ipsilateral involvement correlates with contralateral
metastasis. The tumor of a patients with many metastases in ipsilateral
LNLs was probably able to spread for longer (or faster) compared to a
tumor in a patient with no nodal disease. This, too, may therefore be
considered a surrogate for the duration of the disease. In rare cases,
bulky nodal disease ipsilaterally may also redirect lymph fluids to the
contralateral side.

Lastly, the right panel in figure~\ref{fig-data-strat} shows that
patients with a tumor crossing the mid-sagittal line show contralateral
involvement vastly more often compared to patients with clearly
lateralized tumors. This makes intutitive sense, because the lymphatic
system in the head and neck region is typically symmetric and thus no
major vessels cross the midline. Therefore, interstitial fluids from the
primary tumor -- which we assume to carry living malignant cells -- may
only reach the blind-ended lymphatic vessels in the contralateral neck
via short-ranged diffusion. Which in turn is only possible when the
primary tumor is close enough to the mid-sagittal line or crosses it.

\subsection{Requirements for a Bilateral
Model}\label{requirements-for-a-bilateral-model}

Based on the observations of the \hyperref[sec-data-strat]{previous
section}, any potential model that aims to also predict the risk for
contralateral nodal involvement, should be able to take the following
into account:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  More advanced T-category should lead to higher risk for nodal disease.
  One approach to achieve this via the expected time of diagnosis has
  already been developed in the form of a hidden Markov model (Ludwig et
  al. 2021).
\item
  The degree of ipsilateral involvement should give the model
  information on the time that may have passed between onset and
  diagnosis of the disease. This should come in addition to what can be
  inferred about this time from T-category alone.
\item
  A tumor that extends over the mid-sagittal line should yield
  contralateral metastases with much higher probability.
\end{enumerate}

Over the course of this work, we will first briefly recap the mentioned
HMM in section~\ref{sec-unilateral}, which was so far used to model
ipsilateral lymphatic progression only. Then, we intuitively extend it
to include the contralateral side as well in
section~\ref{sec-ext-to-contra}. In this section, we also introduce a
way of modelling the tumor's midline extension as a random variable
(section~\ref{sec-midline}) and lastly talk about how it may affect the
contralateral spread in section~\ref{sec-params-symmetry}.

\subsection{Data Availability}\label{data-availability}

The entire data, including additional patients with tumors in other
primary locations than the oropharynx, is publicly available: It may be
\href{https://lyprox.org/patients/dataset}{downloaded from LyProX} where
it can be interactively explored too,
\href{https://github.com/rmnldwg/lydata}{from GitHub},
\href{https://zenodo.org/search?q=lydata}{from zenodo}, or via the
\emph{Data-in-Brief} publications Ludwig et al. (2022) and Ludwig et al.
(2023). Although these publications do not include the most recent
dataset addition from Vall d'Hebron Barcelona Hospital.

\section{Unilateral Model for Lymphatic
Progression}\label{sec-unilateral}

\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{fig-small-graph}Directed acyclic graph (DAG)
representing the abstract lymphatic network in the head and neck region.
Blue nodes are the LNLs' hidden random variables, the red node
represents the tumor, and the orange square nodes depict the binary
observed variables. Red and blue arcs symbolize the probability of
lymphatic spread along that edge during one time-step. The orange arcs
represent the sensitivity and specificity of the observational modality
(e.g.~CT, MRI, pathology, \ldots).}

\end{figure}%

Our first model to predict the lymphatic progression of HNSCC was
introduced using Bayesian networks (Pouymayou et al. 2019). We
subsequently extended this work to a hidden Markov model (HMM) (Ludwig
et al. 2020) to allow an intuitive inclusion of T-category into the
predictions. We will briefly summarize this HMM's formalism before
building on it to include the contralateral spread in
section~\ref{sec-ext-to-contra}.

We model a patient's state of involvement at an abstract time-step \(t\)
as a vector of hidden binary random variables:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-state-def}{
\mathbf{X}[t] = \begin{pmatrix} X_v[t] \end{pmatrix} \qquad v \in \left\{ 1, 2, \ldots, V \right\}
}\end{equation}

Here, \(V\) is the number of LNLs the model considers. The values a
LNL's hidden binary RV may take on are \(X_v[t] = 0\) (\texttt{False}),
meaning the LNL \(v\) is healthy or free of metastatic disease, or
\(X_v[t] = 1\) (\texttt{True}), corresponding to some for of tumor
presence (i.e., occult or clinical).

Since the state vector \(\mathbf{X}[t]\) is \(V\)-dimensional and
binary, there are \(2^V\) distinct possible lymphatic involvement
patterns, which we enumerate from
\(\boldsymbol{\xi}_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \end{pmatrix}\)
to
\(\boldsymbol{\xi}_{2^V} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

Any hidden Markov model is fully described by three quantities:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A starting state \(\mathbf{X}[t=0]\) at time \(t=0\) just before the
  patient's tumor formed. In our case, this is always the state where
  all LNLs are still healthy \(\boldsymbol{\xi}_0\).
\item
  The \emph{transition matrix}
  \begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-trans-matrix}{
  \mathbf{A} = \left( A_{ij} \right) = \big( P \left( \mathbf{X}[t+1] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_j \mid \mathbf{X}[t] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_i \right) \big)
  }\end{equation} where the value at row \(i\) and column \(j\)
  represents the probability to transition from state
  \(\boldsymbol{\xi}_i\) to \(\boldsymbol{\xi}_j\) during the time-step
  from \(t\) to \(t+1\). Note that we prohibit self-healing, meaning
  that during a transition, no LNL may change their state from
  \(X_v[t]=1\) to \(X_v[t+1]=0\). This effectively masks large parts of
  the transition matrix to be zero.
\item
  Lastly, the \emph{observation matrix}
  \begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-obs-matrix}{
  \mathbf{B} = \left( B_{ij} \right) = \big( P \left( \mathbf{Z} = \boldsymbol{\zeta}_j \mid \mathbf{X}[t_D] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_i \right) \big)
  }\end{equation} where in row \(i\) and at column \(j\) we find the
  probability to \emph{observe} a lymphatic involvement pattern
  \(\mathbf{Z} = \boldsymbol{\zeta}_j\), given that the true (but
  hidden) state of involvement at the time of diagnosis \(t_D\) is
  \(\mathbf{X}[t_D] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_i\).
\end{enumerate}

Note that the transition matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) is parametrized using the
spread probabilities of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that we define as
the underlying mechanistic representation of the lymphatic network. An
example of such a DAG is shown in figure~\ref{fig-small-graph}.

Using the introduced quantities, we can evolve the distribution of all
possible hidden states from \(\mathbf{X}[t=0] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_0\)
step by step, by successively multiplying this vector with the
transition matrix \(\mathbf{A}\). At the time of the diagnosis \(t_D\),
we multiply the result with the observation matrix \(\mathbf{B}\). We
may then look up the likelihood of a patient presenting with the
diagnosis \(\mathbf{Z}=\boldsymbol{\zeta}_i\) in the \(i\)-th entry of
the final result.

However, the remaining issue is that the value of \(t_D\) is unknown,
i.e.~over how many time-steps the HMM should be evolved. We solve this
problem by marginalizing over the time of diagnosis. Different
distributions over the diagnosis times can then be choosen based on
T-category. For instance, the mean of the time-prior to marginalize over
the diagnosis time for early T-category patients
\(P\left( t_D \mid \text{early} \right)\) may be shifted towards earlier
times than the one for advanced T-category patients
\(P\left( t_D \mid \text{early} \right)\). This gives us for example

\[
P\left( \mathbf{X} \mid \text{T}x = \text{early} \right) = \sum_{t=0}^{t_\text{max}} P \left( \mathbf{X} \mid t \right) \cdot P(t \mid \text{early})
\]

For later use, we define at this point the matrices
\(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\):

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-lambda-matrix}{
\boldsymbol{\Lambda} = P \left( \mathbf{X} \mid \mathbf{t} \right) = \begin{pmatrix}
\boldsymbol{\pi}^\intercal \cdot \mathbf{A}^0 \\
\boldsymbol{\pi}^\intercal \cdot \mathbf{A}^1 \\
\vdots \\
\boldsymbol{\pi}^\intercal \cdot \mathbf{A}^{t_\text{max}} \\
\end{pmatrix}
}\end{equation}

Where the \(k\)-th row in this matrix corresponds to the distribution
over hidden states after \(t=k-1\) time-steps.

In this work, we use binomial distributions
\(\mathfrak{B} \left( t_D, p_{\text{T}x} \right)\) as time-priors which
have one free parameter \(p_{\text{T}x}\) for each group of patients we
differentiate based on T-category. Also, we fix \(t_\text{max} = 10\),
which means that the expected number of time-steps from the onset of a
patient's disease to their diagnosis is
\(\mathbb{E}\left[ t_D \right] = 10 \cdot p_{\text{T}x}\).

\subsection{Likelihood Function}\label{likelihood-function}

With the formalism introduced above, we can write the likelihood
function for a patient to present with a diagnosis consisting of an
observed state and a T-category
\(d = \left( \boldsymbol{\zeta}_i, \text{T}x \right)\) as follows:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-single-patient-llh}{
\ell = P \left( \mathbf{Z} = \boldsymbol{\zeta}_i \mid \text{T}x \right) = \sum_{t=0}^{t_\text{max}} \left[ \boldsymbol{\xi}_0 \cdot \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} \right]_i \cdot P \left( t \mid \text{T}x \right)
}\end{equation}

Above, the quantity inside \(\left[ \ldots \right]_i\) denotes the
\(i\)-th component of the vector that is the result of the vector and
matrix multiplications in the square brackets. Note that it is also
possible to account for missing involvement information: If a diagnosis
(like fine needle aspiration (FNA)) is only available for a subset of
all LNLs, we can sum over all those possible complete observed states
\(\boldsymbol{\zeta}_j\) that match the provided diagnosis.

The single-patient likelihood \(\ell\) in
equation~\ref{eq-single-patient-llh} depends on the spread parameters
shown in figure~\ref{fig-small-graph} via the transition matrix
\(\mathbf{A}\) and on the binomial parameters \(p_{\text{T}x}\) via
time-priors. In this work, we will only differentiate between ``early''
(T1 \& T2) and ``advanced'' (T3 \& T4) T-categories. Therefore, our
parameter space is:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-param-space}{
\boldsymbol{\theta} = \left( \left\{ b_v \right\}, \left\{ t_{vr} \right\}, p_\text{early}, p_\text{adv.} \right) \quad \text{with} \quad \genfrac{}{}{0pt}{2}{v\leq V}{r\in\operatorname{pa}(v)}
}\end{equation}

And it is our goal to infer the values of these parameters for a given
dataset \(\mathcal{D} = \left( d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_N \right)\) of OPSCC
patients. The likelihood of these \(N\) diagnoses is simply the product
of their individual likelihoods as defined in
equation~\ref{eq-single-patient-llh}. For numerical reasons, we
typically compute the data likelihood in log space:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-log-likelihood}{
\log \mathcal{L} \left( \mathcal{D} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta} \right) = \sum_{i=1}^N \log \ell_i
}\end{equation}

The methodology we use to infer the model's parameters is detailed in
section~\ref{sec-sampling}.

\subsection{Model Prediction in the Bayesian
Context}\label{model-prediction-in-the-bayesian-context}

Our stated goal is to compute the risk for a patient's true nodal
involvement state \(\mathbf{X}\), \emph{given} their individual
diagnosis \(d = \left( \boldsymbol{\zeta}_k, \text{T}x \right)\). Using
Bayes' law, this is written as:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-uni-bayes-law}{
P \big( \mathbf{X} \mid \mathbf{Z}=\boldsymbol{\zeta}_k, \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}, \text{T}x \big) = \frac{P \left( \boldsymbol{\zeta}_k \mid \mathbf{X} \right) P \big( \mathbf{X} \mid \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}, \text{T}x \big)}{\sum_{i=0}^{2^V} P \left( \boldsymbol{\zeta}_k \mid \mathbf{X}=\boldsymbol{\xi}_i \right) P \big( \mathbf{X}=\boldsymbol{\xi}_i \mid \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}, \text{T}x \big)}
}\end{equation}

The term \(P \left( \boldsymbol{\zeta}_k \mid \mathbf{X} \right)\) is
defined solely by sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic
modality. Terms like this already appeared in the definition of the
observation matrx in equation~\ref{eq-obs-matrix}. The \emph{prior}
\(P \big( \mathbf{X} \mid \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}} \big)\) in the above
equation is the crucial term that is supplied by a trained model and its
parameters \(\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}\).

It is possible to compute this \emph{posterior} probability of true
involvement not only for one fully defined state \(\mathbf{X}\), but
also for e.g.~individual LNLs: For example, the risk for involvement in
level IV would be a marginalization over all states
\(\boldsymbol{\xi}_i\), where \(\xi_{i4}=1\). Formally:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-marg-over-posterior}{
P \big( \text{IV} \mid \mathbf{Z}=\boldsymbol{\zeta}_k, \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}, \text{T}x  \big) = \sum_{k \, : \, \xi_{k4}=1} P \big( \mathbf{X} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_k \mid \boldsymbol{\zeta}_k, \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}, \text{T}x  \big)
}\end{equation}

\section{Extension to a Bilateral Model}\label{sec-ext-to-contra}

A naive approach to model the contralateral lymphatic spread would be to
simply employ two independent unilateral models as introduced in
section~\ref{sec-unilateral}. During training, one could even enforce
some shared parameters between these two models, like the
parameterization of the distributions over diagnose times or the spread
among the LNLs. Additionally, we could think of an approach to
incorporate the primary tumor's mid-sagittal extension as a risk factor.

However, this approach lacks a way to describe the correlation between
ipsi- and contralateral involvement. This is displayed in
table~\ref{tbl-data-strat} and shows how often the contralateral LNLs I,
II, III, and IV were involved, given all possible combinations of
midline extension, T-category, and ipsilateral LNL III involvement.
Unsurprisingly, the prevalence for contralateral involvement is
consistently higher when the tumor extends over the mid-sagittal line or
is of later T-category. But it is also more frequent when the
ipsilateral side shows more severe involvement, which is here shown via
the surrogate LNL III.

Thus, we attempt to extend the formalism in section~\ref{sec-unilateral}
in such a way that the model's ipsi- and contralateral side evolve
synchronously. To achieve that, we start by writing down the posterior
distribution of involvement an analogy to
equation~\ref{eq-uni-bayes-law}, which is now a joint probability of an
involvement \(\mathbf{X}^\text{i}\) ipsilaterally \emph{and} an
involvement \(\mathbf{X}^\text{c}\) contralaterally, given a diagnosis
of the ipsilateral LNLs \(\mathbf{Z}^\text{i}\) and of the contralateral
ones \(\mathbf{Z}^\text{c}\):

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-bilateral-bayes}{
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \right) = \frac{P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right) P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right)}{P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \right)}
}\end{equation}

For the sake of brevity, we omit the dependency on the parameters and
the T-category here.

The likelihood of the diagnoses given a hidden state simply factorise:
\(P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right) = P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i} \right) \cdot P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right)\).
And the two factors are contained in the observation matrices
\(\mathbf{B}^\text{i}\) and \(\mathbf{B}^\text{c}\).

The term representing the model's prior probability of hidden
involvement does not factorize. However, if we assume that lymphatic
spread typically does not cross the mid-sagittal line, we can write it
as a factorising sum:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-bilateral-marginal}{
\begin{aligned}
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right) &= \sum_{t=0}^{t_\text{max}} P(t) \cdot P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid t \right) \\
&= \sum_{t=0}^{t_\text{max}} P(t) \cdot P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i} \mid t \right) \cdot P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid t \right)
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation}

This assumption makes intuitive sense: The two sides of the lymphatic
network in a typical patient are approximately mirror images of each
other. Thus, no major vessels cross the mid-sagittal line. There may,
however, be diffusion of lymph fluid accross this line or bulky
involvement that redirects lymphatic drainage significantly.

Using this assumption along with equation~\ref{eq-lambda-matrix}, we can
write the above distribution algebraically as a product:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-bilateral-marginal-algebra}{
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_n, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_m \right) = \left[ \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^\intercal_\text{i} \cdot \operatorname{diag} P(\mathbf{t}) \cdot \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_\text{c} \right]_{n,m}
}\end{equation}

\subsection{Modelling Midline Extension}\label{sec-midline}

To account for the increased prevalence of involvement on the
contralateral side when the tumor is not clearly lateralized anymore, we
also model the tumor's extension over the mid-sagittal line as a binary
random variable. It starts lateralized and at every time-step there is a
finite probability \(p_\epsilon\) that the tumor grows over the symmetry
plane of the patient.

Technically, the introduction of this additional random variable doubles
the space of the hidden states and therefore quadruples the size of the
transition matrix \(\mathbf{A}\). However, since we assume no
correlation between the tumor's lateralization and the metastases in the
LNLs, we can evolve the two parts separately.

The probabilities to find a patient with a clearly lateralized tumor or
one that extends over the mid-sagittal line after \(t\) time-steps are
then given by

\[
\begin{aligned}
P(\epsilon = \texttt{False} \mid t) &= (1 - p_\epsilon)^t \\
P(\epsilon = \texttt{True} \mid t) &= 1 - P(\epsilon = \texttt{False} \mid t)
\end{aligned}
\]

In figure~\ref{fig-model-midext-evo}, we visualize how the prior
distribution over diagnose times \(P(t)\), the conditional probability
of midline extension \(P(\epsilon \mid t)\), and their joint
\(P(\epsilon, t)\) evolve over the course of a patient evolution.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-model-midext-evo}The top panel shows the prior
probability to get diagnosed at time-step \(t\) for early and late
T-category tumors as bars. Also in the top panel, we plot the
conditional probability of the tumor's midline extension
(\(\epsilon=\texttt{True}\)), given the time-step \(t\) as a line plot.
In the bottom panel, we show the joint probability of getting diagnosed
in time-step \(t\) \emph{and} having a tumor that crosses the midline.}

\end{figure}%

Notebook}}

To get the joint probability over the ipsi- and contralateral hidden
states, as well as the state of the tumor's midline extension
\(P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right)\),
we simply add the above terms to the marginalization in
equation~\ref{eq-bilateral-marginal}:

\[
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right) = \sum_{t=0}^{t_\text{max}} P(t) \cdot P(\epsilon \mid t) \cdot P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i} \mid t \right) \cdot P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid t \right)
\]

Again, this can be written algebraically, by defining the vector
\(P(\mathbf{t}, \epsilon) = P(\mathbf{t}) \cdot P(\epsilon \mid \mathbf{t})\),
to achieve the same form as in
equation~\ref{eq-bilateral-marginal-algebra}:

\[
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_n, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_m, \epsilon \right) = \left[ \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^\intercal_\text{i} \cdot \operatorname{diag} P(\mathbf{t}, \epsilon) \cdot \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_\text{c} \right]_{n,m}
\]

In figure~\ref{fig-model-state-dist} we plot the state distribution for
a full midline model as two separate heatmaps. To keep it readable, this
example model only considers the LNLs II, III, and IV ipsi- and
contralaterally.

\subsection{Parameter Symmetries}\label{sec-params-symmetry}

In general, the matrices \(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_\text{i}\) and
\(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_\text{c}\) could be parameterized using a
disjoint set of parameters. I.e., the ipsi- and contralateral spread
rates are entirely different. However, using two sensible assumptions,
we can reduce the parameter space by sharing some parameters between the
sides:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We assume the spread \emph{among} the LNLs to be same on both sides.
  It is reasonable to assume the lymphatic system is symmetric. Thus,
  the spread rates from one LNL to the other should be symmetric, too.
  Formally, this means\\
  \begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-symmetries}{
  \begin{aligned}
  b_v^\text{c} &\neq b_v^\text{i} \\
  t_{rv}^\text{c} &= t_{rv}^\text{i}
  \end{aligned}
  }\end{equation} for all \(v \leq V\) and
  \(r \in \operatorname{pa}(v)\).
\item
  The tumor's spread to the contralateral side in case of an extension
  over the midline is larger than if it was clearly lateralized, but
  smaller than its spread to the ipsilateral side. This assumption stems
  from a simple thought experiment: Consider moving the tumor from a
  clearly lateralized position accross the mid-sagittal plane to the
  same position, but on the contralateral side. In the beginning we
  would have \(b_v^\text{c} < b_v^\text{i}\), while in the end, the
  situation is reversed. If a tumor extends over the mid-sagittal line,
  its contralateral spread rate can be expected to be in between these
  two extremes. We encode this in a \emph{mixing parameter} \(\alpha\)
  that captures a ``degree of asymmetry'':\\
  \begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-mixing}{
  b_v^{\text{c},\epsilon=\texttt{True}} = \alpha \cdot b_v^\text{i} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot b_v^{\text{c},\epsilon=\texttt{False}}
  }\end{equation} This means the model now uses three different sets of
  parameters to describe the spread from the tumor to the LNLs:
  \(b^\text{i}_v\) for the spread to the ipsilateral LNLs,
  \(b_v^{\text{c},\epsilon=\texttt{False}}\) for the spread to the
  contralateral LNLs as long as the tumor is clearly lateralized, and
  finally \(b_v^{\text{c},\epsilon=\texttt{True}}\) when it crosses the
  midline. Note, however, that these three sets of spread rates only
  account for \(2 \cdot 2^V + 1\) parameters, since they are coupled via
  the mixing parameter \(\alpha\).
\end{enumerate}

Together with the explicit modelling of the tumor's midline extension
\(\epsilon\) from section~\ref{sec-midline}, we now have a model that
may be capable of capturing the higher prevalence of contralateral
involvment that comes with tumors extending over the mid-sagittal line.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

We compared three different aprroaches to modelling the contralateral
involvement in OPSCC:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A naive model of the contralateral side only. Neither the patterns of
  ipsilateral involvement, nor the information on whether the patients'
  tumors crossed the mid-sagittal line enter this model.
\item
  The bilateral model as introduced in the sections up to and including
  section~\ref{sec-params-symmetry}. The involvement patterns of both
  sides enter this model, but not whether the tumors extended the
  midline.
\item
  An additional bilateral model that tracks the midline extension of the
  patients' tumors as a random variable. This includes the formalism
  introduced up to and including section~\ref{sec-midline}. In contrast
  to the other two models, it does consider the reported midline
  extension in the data to attempt a more accurate prediction of the
  risk for contralateral occult disease.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{MCMC Sampling}\label{sec-sampling}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  all models initialized with the same settings

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    same graph
  \item
    same data
  \item
    same distributions over diagnose time
  \end{itemize}
\item
  parameter samples were drawn for all three models:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the sampling used 12 walkers per parameter space dimension.
  \item
    Every 50 steps, convergence was checked
  \item
    convergence was reached when two criteria were met:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      the relative difference between subsequent autocorrelation
      estimates of the chain does not change more than 5.0e-2.
    \item
      the autocorrelation estimate of the chain drops below the length
      of the chain divided by 50.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    after convergence, 10 samples (from the parallel walkers) were drawn
    that were spaced 10 steps apart, resulting in
    \texttt{num\ params\ x\ 12\ x\ 10} parameter samples.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

For every model, we compare the predicted prevalence of a certain
scenario to how often this scenario is seen in the data. The considered
scenarios are choosen to test if the models can take into account
T-category, the correlation of ipsi- and contralateral involvement, and
the primary tumor's lateralization (whether or not it extends over the
mid-sagittal line).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item[$\square$]
  list and describe the scenarios
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computing the Observed and Predicted Prevalence of
Involvement
Patterns}\label{computing-the-observed-and-predicted-prevalence-of-involvement-patterns}

We want to assess the model's capability to approximate the distribution
of lymphatic involvement patterns seen in the data. To that end, we
compare the prevalence of some invovlement patterns under selected
scenarios with the model's prediction for how often these involvements
it expects to see, given these scenarios.

In this context, a ``scenario'' includes the patient's T-category
\(\text{T}x\) and whether the patient's tumor extended over the
mid-sagittal line, i.e.~\(\epsilon=\texttt{True}\) or
\(\epsilon=\texttt{False}\).

An involvement pattern specifies for each ipsi- and contralateral LNL
whether it is ``healthy'', ``involved'', or ``masked''. If it is
``masked'', we essentially state that we are not interested in the
involvement of that LNL and the prevalence will be marginalized over
this LNL's involvement.

For example, we may be interested in the prevalence of contralateral LNL
II involvement (i.e., contra LNL II ``involved'' and all other LNLs
``masked'') under the scenario of early T-category (T0-T2) and no
midline extension (\(\epsilon=\texttt{False}\)). To compute this
prevalence in the data, we select all patients of this scenario (in our
data, this amounts to patients). Of those, were found to harbor
metastases in their contralateral LNL II. Therefore, the prevalence is .

When displaying this data prevalence, we often choose to draw a
\emph{Beta posterior} over the ``true'' prevalence, hinting at the fact
that our data merely represents a limited sample. The Beta posterior
follows from a uniform Beta distribution as prior and a Bernoulli
likelihood for the number of patients with the involvement of interest,
given the parameer for the ``true'' prevalence. The resulting
distribution has its maximum at the observed prevalence, but in addition
gives a visual intuition for the variance of of the observed quantity.
I.e., when we observe 3 out of 10 events, the Beta posterior is much
wider than if we observe 300 out of 1000 for he same prevalence. It also
allows us to check not inly if the model is accurate, but also whether
it reflects the uncertainty contained in the data.

Predicting the prevalence using our model amounts to computing the
following probability:

\[
P \left( \text{II}^\text{c} \mid \epsilon=\texttt{False}, \text{T}x=\text{early} \right) = \frac{P \left( \text{II}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{False} \mid \text{T}x=\text{early} \right)}{P \left( \epsilon=\texttt{False} \mid \text{T}x=\text{early} \right)}
\]

In the enumator, we marginalize over all ipsi- and contralateral LNLs'
involvements, except for LNL II contralaterally. This is similar to the
marginalization in equation~\ref{eq-marg-over-posterior}, although we
are summing over different quantities. In the denominator, we can simply
insert the joint distribution over midline extension and diagnose time
\(P \left( \epsilon, t \right)\) marginalized over \(t\) using the early
T-category's time-prior.

Since we compare it to the data, which does not report true but only
observed involvement -- although pathologically investigated LNLs may be
as close as possible to the ground truth -- we do not consider
posteriors of the form \(P \left( \mathbf{X} \mid \mathbf{Z} \right)\)
here. Instead, we compute probabilities of observed involvement
\(P \left( \mathbf{Z} \right)\), as in the likelihood
equation~\ref{eq-single-patient-llh}.

When plotted, we usually display histograms over the model's
predictions. Each of their values was computed from a different
parameter set drawn during MCMC sampling, effectively giving us a
distribution over the prevalences. Ideally, the histograms approximate
the location and width of the Beta posteriors when attempting to
describe the data they were trained on.

Note that we decided to omit the y-axis ticks and labels in these
figures over prevalences and risks. The y-axis in these plots measures
the probability density and its numerical values are not intuitively
interpretable. Instead, we occasionally use the freed space to label
e.g.~rows of subplots.

\subsection{Prevalence Predictions}\label{prevalence-predictions}

In figure~\ref{fig-model-prevalences-overall}, we plot the prevalence of
contralateral involvement of the LNLs II, III, and IV for the four
scenarios made up of the possible combinations of early and late
T-category, as well as lateralized and midline extending tumors.

\caption{\label{fig-model-prevalences-overall}Comparison of predicted
(histograms) vs observed (beta posteriors) prevalences. Shown for the
contralateral LNLs II (blue), III (orange), and IV (green). The top row
shows scenarios with early T-category tumors, the bottom row for late
T-category ones. The left column depicts scenarios where the primary
tumor is clearly lateralized, the right column scenarios of tumors
extending over the mid-sagittal line. This figure illustrates the
model's ability to describe the prevalence of different combinations of
scenarios involving the risk factors T-category and midline extension.}

\end{figure}%

\textsubscript{Source:
\href{https://rmnldwg.github.io/bilateral-paper/manuscript-preview.html}{Article
Notebook}}

Figure~\ref{fig-model-prevalences-overall} shows nicely how the model is
capable of accurately taking the most important risk factors,
i.e.~T-category and midline extension, into account. As observed in the
data, the model predicts that the prevalence of contralateral LNL II
involvement jumps from below 8\% for early T-category lateralized tumors
to almost 40\% when the tumor is of advanced T-category and crosses the
mid-sagittal line.

However, for early T-category scenarios with midline extension, the
model does seem to overestimate contralateral LNL II invovlement and
underestimate the prevalence for metastases in LNL III. This likely
stems from the the small sample size of this rare scenario as hinted at
by the wide Beta posteriors.

\subsubsection{Correlation between Ipsi- and Contralateral
Involvement}\label{correlation-between-ipsi--and-contralateral-involvement}

\begin{figure}[H]

\centering{

\includegraphics{manuscript_files/figure-latex/model-fig-model-prevalences-with-ipsi-output-1.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-model-prevalences-with-ipsi}Comparison of predicted
(histograms) vs observed (beta posteriors) prevalences. Shown are four
scenarios, all including contralateral LNL II involvement: Early
T-category and an ipsilateral N0 neck (green), early T-category and
ipsilateral LNL II involvement (blue), as well as the same two scenarios
but for advanced T-category (orange and red). The figure shows that the
model is capable of describing the correlation between ipsi- and
contralateral involvement. Although for the scenario of LNL II
involvement in both sides, the prediction's split between early and
advanced T-category is not large enough.}

\end{figure}%

\textsubscript{Source:
\href{https://rmnldwg.github.io/bilateral-paper/manuscript-preview.html}{Article
Notebook}}

In figure~\ref{fig-model-prevalences-with-ipsi} we display the model's
ability to capture the correlation between ipsi- and contralateral
involvement. It shows that the prevalence of metastases in the two sides
of the neck is correlated via the time of diagnosis, despite the model
not having any direct connections between the two side. However, there
are some small discrepancies in the model's prediction: When considering
the scenario of LNL II involvement in the ipsi- \emph{and} contralateral
side, it cannot quite capture the split between early and late
T-category. The model slightly overestimates the prevalence of this
scenario for early T-category patients and underestimates it for
advanced T-category.

\subsubsection{Midline Extension}\label{midline-extension}

\begin{figure}[H]

\centering{

\includegraphics{manuscript_files/figure-latex/model-fig-model-prevalences-midext-output-1.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-model-prevalences-midext}Comparing the predicted
(histograms) and observed (lines depicting beta posteriors) prevalence
of midline extension for early (blue) and late (orange) T-category.
While the prevalence is predicted correctly when marginalizing over
T-category, the model cannot capture the degree of separation observed
in the data. Since the tumor's midline extension is virtually always
part of the diagnosis and hence \emph{given} when predicting a patient's
risk, we do not consider this discrepancy a major issue.}

\end{figure}%

\textsubscript{Source:
\href{https://rmnldwg.github.io/bilateral-paper/manuscript-preview.html}{Article
Notebook}}

Lastly, in figure~\ref{fig-model-prevalences-midext}, we plot the
prevalence of midline extension in the data versus our model's
prediction. It is obvious the model cannot match the large spread
between early and advanced T-category seen in the data. This is because
to achieve that, it would need to increase the advanced T-category
patient's prior distribution over diagnosis times and at the same time
reduce the probability of the tumor to cross the midline during a
time-step. But since the time-priors parameter is also coupled with the
spread probabilities among the LNLs, the model does not have that
freedom.

However, we do not consider this discrepancy a major limitation of the
model: We will not realistically be interested in the probability of
midline extension, as it is always possible to assess it with high
certainty. That is also the reason why we initially modelled the midline
extension \emph{not} as a random variable, but as a global risk factor
that would have been turned on or off from the onset of a patient's
disease evolution. This, however, lead to overly high risks for
contralateral involvement in advanced T-category patients with midline
extension, because then the model assumes an increased spread to the
contralateral side from the onset of the disease. Which is probably not
true in a majority of those cases. Thus, treating it as a random
variable that only becomes true during a patient's disease evolution
resulted in a better description of the data.

Formally, the wrong prediction of midline extension prevalence makes
little difference, since it is always given: Instead of
\(P\left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \mid \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \right)\),
we typically compute
\(P\left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right)\),
which does not suffer from the wrong probability of midline extension,
as the distribution over hidden states is renormalized:

\[
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right) = \frac{P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right) P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right)}{P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right)}
\]

Note that a distribution over \(\epsilon\) appears both in the
enumerator and the denominator, which largely cancel each other, leaving
only the midline extension's effect on the distribution over hidden
states in the prediction.
