<meta name="citation_abstract" content="Purpose: Current guidelines for elective nodal irradiation in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) recommend including large portions of the contralateral lymphatic system in the clinical target volume (CTV-N), even for lateralized tumors with no clinical lymph node involvement in the contralateral neck. This study introduces a probabilistic model of bilateral lymphatic tumor progression in OPSCC to estimate personalized risks of occult disease in specific lymph node levels (LNLs) based on clinical lymph node involvement, T-stage, and tumor lateralization.

Methods: Building on a previously developed hidden Markov model for ipsilateral lymphatic spread, we extend the approach to contralateral neck involvement. The model represents LNLs I, II, III, IV, V, and VII on both sides of the neck as binary hidden variables (healthy or involved), connected via arcs representing spread probabilities. These probabilities are learned using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from a dataset of 833 OPSCC patients, enabling the model to reflect the underlying lymphatic progression dynamics.

Results: The model accurately and precisely describes observed patterns of lymph node involvement with a compact set of interpretable parameters. Midline extension of the primary tumor is identified as the primary risk factor for contralateral involvement, with advanced T-stage and extensive ipsilateral involvement further increasing risk. The model highlights key hierarchical dependencies: occult disease in contralateral LNL III is highly unlikely if upstream LNL II is clinically negative, and in contralateral LNL IV, occult disease is exceedingly rare without LNL III involvement.

Conclusions: This model offers an interpretable, probabilistic framework to inform personalized elective CTV-N volume reduction. For lateralized tumors that do not cross the midline, it suggests the contralateral neck may safely be excluded from elective irradiation. For tumors extending across the midline but with a clinically negative contralateral neck, elective irradiation could be limited to LNL II, reducing unnecessary exposure while maintaining oncological safety.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in the Primary Staging of Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review of the Literature;,citation_abstract=Context Management of newly diagnosed prostate cancer (PCa) is guided in part by accurate clinical staging. The role of imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), in initial staging remains controversial. Objective To systematically review the studies of MRI and/or PET/CT in the staging of newly diagnosed PCa with respect to tumor (T), nodal (N), and metastatic (M) staging (TNM staging). Evidence acquisition We performed a systematic review of the literature using MEDLINE and Web of Science databases between 2012 and 2020 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Evidence synthesis A total of 139 studies (83 on T, 47 on N, and 24 on M status) were included. Ninety-nine (71%) were retrospective, 39 (28%) were prospective, and one was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Most studies on T staging examined MRI, while PET/CT was used primarily for N and M staging. Sensitivity for the detection of extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, or lymph node invasion ranged widely. When imaging was incorporated into existing risk tools, gain in accuracy was observed in some studies, although these findings have not been replicated. For M staging, most favorable results were reported for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT, which demonstrated significantly better performance than conventional imaging. Conclusions A variety of studies on modern imaging techniques for TNM staging in newly diagnosed PCa exist. For T and N staging, reported sensitivity of imaging modalities such as MRI or PET/CT varied widely due to data heterogeneity, small sample size, and low event rates resulting in large confidence intervals and a high level of uncertainty. Therefore, uniformity in data presentation and standardization on this topic are needed. The most promising technique for M staging, which was evaluated recently in an RCT, is PSMA-PET/CT. Patient summary We performed a systematic review of currently available imaging modalities to stage newly diagnosed prostate cancer. With respect to local tumor and lymph node assessment, performance of imaging ranged widely. However, prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed favorable results for the detection of distant metastases.;,citation_author=Raisa S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Contralateral regional recurrence after elective unilateral neck irradiation in oropharyngeal carcinoma: A literature-based critical review;,citation_abstract=Background The head and neck region has rich regional lymphatic network, with a theoretical risk on contralateral metastasis from oropharyngeal cancer (OPC). There is a long-standing convention to irradiate the great majority of these tumors electively to both sides of the neck to reduce the risk of contralateral regional failure (cRF), but this can induce significant toxicity. We aimed to identify patient groups where elective contralateral irradiation may safely be omitted. Methods PubMed and EMBASE were searched for original full-text articles in English with a combination of search terms related to the end points: cRF in OPC primarily treated by radiotherapy only to the ipsilateral neck and identifying predictive factors for increased incidence of cRF. The data from the identified studies were pooled, the incidence of cRF was calculated and the correlation with different predictive factors was investigated. Results Eleven full-text articles met the inclusion criteria. In these studies, 1116 patients were treated to the ipsilateral neck alone. The mean incidence of cRF was 2.42% (range 0–5.9%, 95% CI 1.6–3.5%). The incidence of cRF correlated only with T-stage (p=0.008), and involvement of midline (p=0.001). However, the significant correlation with T-stage can be explained by the very low incidence of cRF among T1 (0.77%), and disappeared when the incidence of cRF was compared between T2, T3,and T4 (p=0.344). Conclusion The incidence of cRF in patients with OPC is very low, with involvement of midline providing the most significant prognosticator. These results call for trials on unilateral elective irradiation in selected groups.;,citation_author=Abrahim Al-Mamgani;,citation_author=Erik Van Werkhoven;,citation_author=Arash Navran;,citation_author=Baris Karakullukcu;,citation_author=Olga Hamming-Vrieze;,citation_author=Melanie Machiels;,citation_author=Lilly-Ann Van Der Velden;,citation_author=Wouter V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Group Testing: An Information Theory Perspective;,citation_abstract=The group testing problem concerns discovering a small number of defective items within a large population by performing tests on pools of items. A test is positive if the pool contains at least one defective, and negative if it contains no defectives. This is a sparse inference problem with a combinatorial flavour, with applications in medical testing, biology, telecommunications, information technology, data science, and more. In this monograph, we survey recent developments in the group testing problem from an information-theoretic perspective. We cover several related developments: efficient algorithms with practical storage and computation requirements, achievability bounds for optimal decoding methods, and algorithm-independent converse bounds. We assess the theoretical guarantees not only in terms of scaling laws, but also in terms of the constant factors, leading to the notion of the {\em rate} of group testing, indicating the amount of information learned per test. Considering both noiseless and noisy settings, we identify several regimes where existing algorithms are provably optimal or near-optimal, as well as regimes where there remains greater potential for improvement. In addition, we survey results concerning a number of variations on the standard group testing problem, including partial recovery criteria, adaptive algorithms with a limited number of stages, constrained test designs, and sublinear-time algorithms.;,citation_author=Matthew Aldridge;,citation_author=Oliver Johnson;,citation_author=Jonathan Scarlett;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06002;,citation_issue=3-4;,citation_doi=10.1561/0100000099;,citation_issn=1567-2190, 1567-2328;,citation_volume=15;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Foundations and Trends in Communications and Information Theory;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An introduction to thermodynamic integration and application to dynamic causal models;,citation_abstract=Abstract In generative modeling of neuroimaging data, such as dynamic causal modeling (DCM), one typically considers several alternative models, either to determine the most plausible explanation for observed data (Bayesian model selection) or to account for model uncertainty (Bayesian model averaging). Both procedures rest on estimates of the model evidence, a principled trade-off between model accuracy and complexity. In the context of DCM, the log evidence is usually approximated using variational Bayes. Although this approach is highly efficient, it makes distributional assumptions and is vulnerable to local extrema. This paper introduces the use of thermodynamic integration (TI) for Bayesian model selection and averaging in the context of DCM. TI is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling which is asymptotically exact but orders of magnitude slower than variational Bayes. In this paper, we explain the theoretical foundations of TI, covering key concepts such as the free energy and its origins in statistical physics. Our aim is to convey an in-depth understanding of the method starting from its historical origin in statistical physics. In addition, we demonstrate the practical application of TI via a series of examples which serve to guide the user in applying this method. Furthermore, these examples demonstrate that, given an efficient implementation and hardware capable of parallel processing, the challenge of high computational demand can be overcome successfully.

This makes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) a valuable evaluation method for further therapeutic stratification. In particular, MRI is indispensable for the decision to refrain from neoadjuvant therapy and to choose a primary surgical approach.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cancer recurrence times from a branching process model;,citation_abstract=Author summary The majority of cancer related deaths are due to the development of secondary tumors called metastases. However, the dynamics of metastases establishment and growth and their relation with the primary tumor evolution are still not clear. A standard treatment starts with the resection of the primary tumor. At this time metastases may have already formed and still be too small to be detected. The presence of only undetectable metastases poses a challenge for deciding on the follow-up therapy. These small metastases could grow to a detectable size—thus leading to a recurrence of the disease—some time after surgery. We are interested in this time until cancer relapse. We present a mathematical model of metastases formation using tools from probability theory and estimate the model parameters for five different cancer types. Our predictions for the probability of visible metastases present at surgery and the mean time to relapse when no visible metastases are found at surgery are both in agreement with clinical data.;,citation_author=Stefano Avanzini;,citation_author=Tibor Antal;,citation_editor=Philip K Maini;,citation_publication_date=2019-11;,citation_cover_date=2019-11;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007423;,citation_issn=1553-7358;,citation_volume=15;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PLOS Computational Biology;,citation_publisher=Public Library of Science;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Vocal-cord Only vs. Complete Laryngeal radiation (VOCAL): A randomized multicentric Bayesian phase II trial;,citation_abstract=Abstract Background Radiotherapy, along with laser surgery, is considered a standard treatment option for patients with early glottic squamous cell cancer (SCC). Historically, patients have received complete larynx radiotherapy (CL-RT) due to fear of swallowing and respiratory laryngeal motion and this remains the standard approach in many academic institutions. Local control (LC) rates with CL-RT have been excellent, however this treatment can carry significant toxicities include adverse voice and swallowing outcomes, along with increased long-term risk of cerebrovascular morbidity. A recent retrospective study reported improved voice quality and similar local control outcomes with focused vocal cord radiotherapy (VC-RT) compared to CL-RT. There is currently no prospective evidence on the safety of VC-RT. The primary objective of this Bayesian Phase II trial is to compare the LC of VC-RT to that of CL-RT in patients with T1N0 glottic SCC. Methods One hundred and fifty-five patients with T1a-b N0 SCC of the true vocal cords that are n ot candidate or declined laser surgery, will be randomized in a 1:3 ratio the control arm (CL-RT) and the experimental arm (VC-RT). Randomisation will be stratified by tumor stage (T1a/T1b) and by site (each site will be allowed to select one preferred radiation dose regimen, to be used in both arms). CL-RT volumes will correspond to the conventional RT volumes, with the planning target volume extending from the top of thyroid cartilage lamina superiorly to the bottom of the cricoid inferiorly. VC-RT volumes will include the involved vocal cord(s) and a margin accounting for respiration and set-up uncertainty. The primary endpoint will be LC at 2-years, while secondary endpoints will include patient-reported outcomes (voice impairment, dysphagia and symptom burden), acute and late toxicity radiation-induced toxicity, overall survival, progression free survival, as well as an optional component of acoustic and objective measures of voice analysis using the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice. Discussion This study would constitute the first prospective evidence on the efficacy and safety of VC-RT in early glottic cancer. If positive, this study would result in the adoption of VC-RT as standard approach in early glottic cancer.

Although intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head and neck cancer was initially developed to spare the parotid gland to reduce xerostomia, attention has recently focused on its utility to selectively decrease radiation dose to specified anatomic structures responsible for a functional swallow. Recent reports have proposed a variety of dose thresholds or constraints to these swallowing-related structures, which may guide IMRT planning with the aim of reducing dysphagia. This critical review of the current literature assesses the feasibility of IMRT to maintain swallowing function and appraises the various dosimetric parameters that have been proposed to help minimize long-term dysphagia. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It served as the basis for consensus recommendations on the selection of the lymph node levels in the neck requiring a treatment. The objective of the study is to compare the prevalence and distribution of neck node metastases in HPV+ and HPV- OP-SCC from a large series of patients with OP-SCC who underwent a cervical lymph-node dissection (LND) as part of their treatment. METHODS: The study concentrated on OP-SCC patients treated by various neck node dissection (LND) procedures from January 2014 to December 2018 in 3 French institutions. Patients with prior head and neck cancer, prior neck surgery, the use of induction chemotherapy, or patients with carcinoma of unknown primary were excluded. HPV-status was assessed by p16 immunohistochemistry. For each patient, the clinical and the pathological nodal status, as well as the distribution of the positive nodes in each neck level (from Ia to V) were reported. RESULTS: Two-hundred and sixty-three patients were included (126 p16-negative (p16-), and 137 p16-positive (p16+). The rate of clinical positive node (cN+) reached 54% and 88.3% in the p16- and p16+ groups, respectively (p&nbsp;$&amp;amp;amp;lt;~$0.001); the corresponding rate of pathological positive node (pN+) reached 61.9% and 91.2%, respectively (p&nbsp;$&amp;lt;~$0.001). Regarding the clinical lymph node distribution, in p16+ patients, more positive nodes were observed in the ipsilateral level IV (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.003), and less positive nodes were observed in the contralateral levels III and IV (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.003 and p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.045, respectively). Regarding the pathologic lymph node distribution in the ipsilateral neck, in the cN0 patients, no significant difference was observed between p16- and p16+ patients (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.33 to 1); in the cN+ patients, the nodes were distributed in levels Ib, II, III, IV and V without differences between the p16- and the p16+ patients. In the contralateral neck of p16- patients, nodes metastases were mainly observed in levels II, III and IV, whereas for the p16+ patients, positive nodes were only observed in level II (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.03). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the higher prevalence of cN+ and pN+ in p16+ OP-SCC patients, but without meaningful difference in the distribution of the lymph node drainage between p16- and p16+ OP-SCC. It indicates that no difference should be made between p16- and p16+ patients regarding the extend of neck treatment.;,citation_author=Laurence Bauwens;,citation_author=Aline Baltres;,citation_author=Danny-Joe Fiani;,citation_author=Philippe Zrounba;,citation_author=Guillaume Buiret;,citation_author=Bertrand Fleury;,citation_author=Nazim Benzerdjeb;,citation_author=Vincent Grégoire;,citation_publication_date=2021-04;,citation_cover_date=2021-04;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.radonc.2021.01.028;,citation_issn=01678140;,citation_pmid=33545255;,citation_volume=157;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Radiotherapy and Oncology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rheology of Swiss Cheese Fondue;,citation_abstract=, Cheese fondue is a popular Swiss dish prepared by melting cheese under the addition of wine, starch, and seasoning. The flow behavior or rheology of fondue is crucial for mouthfeel, flavor release, and the tendency of fondue to cling to the bread. Fondue is a complex multiphase system whose rheology is determined by the interactions of its colloidal ingredients. We establish cheese fondue as a water-continuous system with dispersed fat droplets, charged caseins, and starch granules. Irreversible phase separation, a common issue in fondue preparation, may be prevented by addition of a critical minimum starch concentration. Fondue was found to be a shear-thinning yield stress fluid, which is desirable for mouthfeel and facilitates fondue to cling to the bread for consumption. Fondue showed a viscoelastic stress response around the gel point (G$\prime$ $\approx$ G${&amp;amp;amp;#039;&amp;#039;}$), which is proposed as crucial for the balance of orally perceived gumminess (G$\prime$) and liquidity (G${''}$). Ethanol addition and lowering pH toward the isoelectric point of casein, as associated with wine addition, decrease fondue viscosity due to a decrease in casein micelle size. Below the isoelectric point of casein, fondue is unstable and phase separates, potentially impeding fondue digestion. Thus, fondue rheology is governed by the complex colloidal interactions within its ingredients, and ultimately determines fondue eating experience.;,citation_author=Pascal Bertsch;,citation_author=Laura Savorani;,citation_author=Peter Fischer;,citation_publication_date=2019-01;,citation_cover_date=2019-01;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1021/acsomega.8b02424;,citation_issn=2470-1343, 2470-1343;,citation_pmid=31459386;,citation_volume=4;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=ACS Omega;">

Controversy exists with regards the classification of ECS by different histopathological assessment methods published in the literature. Whilst much focus has been placed on ECS in the setting of head and neck cancer, numerous studies also highlight its significance in a range of other malignancies, including a wide range of gastrointestinal malignancies. Prognostically, the presence of ECS broadly negatively impacts on disease recurrence and survival, with a greater range of studies now demonstrating how the nature and extent of ECS influences disease outcomes. Molecular techniques such as DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry have identified molecular biomarkers associated with ECS. Knowledge of these biomarkers will help guide future broader studies. Technological advancements resulting from the recent -omics revolution and utilising an early, wide-ranging, and integrated approach, provide the prospect of improved identification of biomarkers associated with aggressive phenotype.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A general framework for updating belief distributions;,citation_abstract=Summary We propose a framework for general Bayesian inference. We argue that a valid update of a prior belief distribution to a posterior can be made for parameters which are connected to observations through a loss function rather than the traditional likelihood function, which is recovered as a special case. Modern application areas make it increasingly challenging for Bayesians to attempt to model the true data-generating mechanism. For instance, when the object of interest is low dimensional, such as a mean or median, it is cumbersome to have to achieve this via a complete model for the whole data distribution. More importantly, there are settings where the parameter of interest does not directly index a family of density functions and thus the Bayesian approach to learning about such parameters is currently regarded as problematic. Our framework uses loss functions to connect information in the data to functionals of interest. The updating of beliefs then follows from a decision theoretic approach involving cumulative loss functions. Importantly, the procedure coincides with Bayesian updating when a true likelihood is known yet provides coherent subjective inference in much more general settings. Connections to other inference frameworks are highlighted.;,citation_author=P. G. Bissiri;,citation_author=C. C. Holmes;,citation_author=S. G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Whole Body and Local Muscle Vibration Reduce Artificially Induced Quadriceps Arthrogenic Inhibition;,citation_abstract=Objective To evaluate the effects of whole body vibration (WBV) and local muscle vibration (LMV) on quadriceps function after experimental knee effusion (ie, simulated pathology). Design Randomized controlled trial. Setting Research laboratory. Participants Healthy volunteers (N=43) were randomized to WBV (n=14), LMV (n=16), or control (n=13) groups. Interventions Saline was injected into the knee to induce quadriceps arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI). All groups then performed isometric squats while being exposed to WBV, LMV, or no vibration (control). Main Outcome Measures Quadriceps function was assessed at baseline, immediately after effusion, and immediately and 5 minutes after each intervention (WBV, LMV, control) via voluntary peak torque (VPT) and the central activation ratio (CAR) during maximal isometric knee extension on a multifunction dynamometer. Results The CAR improved in the WBV (11.4%, P=.021) and LMV (7.3%, P$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.001) groups immediately postintervention, but they did not improve in the control group. Similarly, VPT increased by 16.5% (P=.021) in the WBV group and 23% (P=.078) in the LMV group immediately postintervention, but it did not increase in the control group. The magnitudes of improvements in the CAR and VPT did not differ between the WBV and LMV groups. Conclusions Quadriceps AMI is a common complication following knee pathology that produces quadriceps dysfunction and increases the risk of posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Quadriceps strengthening after knee pathology is often ineffective because of AMI. WBV and LMV improve quadriceps function equivocally after simulated knee pathology, effectively minimizing quadriceps AMI. Therefore, these stimuli may be used to enhance quadriceps strengthening, therefore improving the efficacy of rehabilitation and reducing the risk of osteoarthritis.;,citation_author=J.

We hypothesize that decreasing the regions of elective nodal irradiation (ENI) in the neck will lead to less toxicity and better quality of life/functional outcomes while maintaining high disease control rates in patients with favourable prognosis HPV+ OSCC. Methods: HN.10 is a Canadian Cancer Trials Group phase II trial with a primary objective to evaluate the efficacy of primary definitive radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) utilizing volume reduced ENI as measured by 2-year event-free survival (EFS) in patients with low-risk HPV+ OPSCC. Secondary objectives include to evaluate overall survival, local control, regional control, locoregional control, out-of-field regional control, distant metastasis free survival, early and late toxicities of treatment, subjective swallowing functions, quality of life, utilization of healthcare resources, work productivity, and prognostic biomarkers. An imaging and biospecimen bank will be compiled as part of trial conduct. Key eligibility criteria include: pathologically proven diagnosis of HPV+ OPSCC; HPV association determined locally by either p16 immunohistochemistry or direct detection of HPV DNA sequences (e.g. by PCR or in situ hybridization) performed on a core needle or surgical biopsy specimen of the primary tumour or involved cervical lymph node; clinical stage T1-3 N0-1 M0 (UICC/AJCC 8th Ed.); fit for radiotherapy +/-chemoradiotherapy. Statistical Design: The primary endpoint is 2-year EFS. Assuming 2-year EFS to be 91% (Ha) for low-risk HPV-related OPSCC with standard treatment, and that the experimental treatment will be considered as ineffective if the 2-year EFS is $\leq$ 85% (H0), with one-sided alpha of 0.1, a sample size of 100 patients will have 80% power to detect a 6% difference of 2-year EFS. With 3 years of accrual and 2 years of follow-up, the total duration of this study will be 5 years. A total of 304.7 person-years of follow-up is needed for the final analysis. The null hypothesis (H0) will be rejected when the observed survival rate is 88.85% or higher (i.e. if there are 18 or fewer EFS events observed). Conduct to Date: Study activation February 20, 2019.

There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6%), prostate cancer (7.1%), and colorectal cancer (6.1%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2%), stomach cancer (8.2%), and liver cancer (8.2%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

Information on the protein is scarce, because of its high tendency of aggregation. We determined suitable conditions to produce a functional human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 L2 protein and thereby provide the opportunity for extensive in vitro analysis with respect to structural and biochemical information on L2 proteins and mechanistic details in viral entry. We produced the L2 protein of high-risk HPV 16 in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and purified the protein under denaturing conditions. A successive buffer screen resulted in suitable conditions for the biophysical characterization of 16L2. Analytical ultracentrifugation of the refolded protein showed a homogenous monomeric species. Furthermore, refolded 16L2 shows secondary structure elements. The N-terminal region including the proposed transmembrane region of 16L2 shows alpha-helical characteristics. However, overall 16L2 appears largely unstructured. Refolded 16L2 is capable of binding to DNA indicating that the putative DNA-binding regions are accessible in refolded 16L2. Further the refolded protein interacts with liposomal membranes presumably via the proposed transmembrane region at neutral pH without structural changes. This indicates that 16L2 can initially interact with membranes via pre-existing structural features.;,citation_author=Bastian Breiner;,citation_author=Laura Preuss;,citation_author=Nora Roos;,citation_author=Marcel Conrady;,citation_author=Hauke Lilie;,citation_author=Thomas Iftner;,citation_author=Claudia Simon;,citation_publication_date=2019-04;,citation_cover_date=2019-04;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1515/hsz-2018-0311;,citation_issn=1437-4315, 1431-6730;,citation_volume=400;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Biological Chemistry;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Mixture of Risk Prediction Models for Tailored CTV Definition in Tumor Treatment;,citation_abstract=Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) frequently spread through the lymphatic system, forming metastases in various lymph nodes. Since these metastases are often too small to be detected in clinical images, large volumes of the lymphatic system in the head and neck region are prophylactically irradiated to avoid nodal recurrences. The elective volume is defined in guidelines for definitive head and neck cancer therapy. However, these guidelines neglect correlations between affected lymph nodes and rely solely on generalized tumor location categories without considering the specific anatomical origins indicated by ICD codes. In this work, we demonstrate that each ICD code exhibits unique lymph node involvement patterns. We introduce a mixture model (MM) based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which enables the prediction of lymph node level (LNL) involvement by incorporating the patient diagnosis, along with T-category and the specific ICD code of the primary tumor. The MM is trained on a multicentric dataset with exact LNL involvement information for primary tumors in the Oral Cavity, Oropharynx, Hypopharynx, and Larynx. The learned parameters of the mixture model are highly interpretable. Application of the MM provide accurate predictions of LNL involvement over the ICD codes.

In this review, we describe metastasis related to OSCC, and disorders that could lead to OSCC with common etiological factors. In addition, a brief account of the diagnosis of OSCC and role of salivary biomarkers in its early detection has also been highlighted.

The review concludes that OSCC has the potential for regional as well as distant metastasis, and many potentially malignant diseases can transform into OSCC with the help of various etiological factors. Diagnosis of OSCC involves traditional biopsy, but salivary biomarkers could also be utilized for early recognition.;,citation_author=Amr Bugshan;,citation_author=Imran Farooq;,citation_publication_date=2020-04;,citation_cover_date=2020-04;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.12688/f1000research.22941.1;,citation_issn=2046-1402;,citation_pmid=32399208;,citation_volume=9;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=F1000Research;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A decision-theoretic approach to Bayesian clinical trial design and evaluation of robustness to prior-data conflict;,citation_abstract=Summary Bayesian clinical trials allow taking advantage of relevant external information through the elicitation of prior distributions, which influence Bayesian posterior parameter estimates and test decisions. However, incorporation of historical information can have harmful consequences on the trial’s frequentist (conditional) operating characteristics in case of inconsistency between prior information and the newly collected data. A compromise between meaningful incorporation of historical information and strict control of frequentist error rates is therefore often sought. Our aim is thus to review and investigate the rationale and consequences of different approaches to relaxing strict frequentist control of error rates from a Bayesian decision-theoretic viewpoint. In particular, we define an integrated risk which incorporates losses arising from testing, estimation, and sampling. A weighted combination of the integrated risk addends arising from testing and estimation allows moving smoothly between these two targets. Furthermore, we explore different possible elicitations of the test error costs, leading to test decisions based either on posterior probabilities, or solely on Bayes factors. Sensitivity analyses are performed following the convention which makes a distinction between the prior of the data-generating process, and the analysis prior adopted to fit the data. Simulation in the case of normal and binomial outcomes and an application to a one-arm proof-of-concept trial, exemplify how such analysis can be conducted to explore sensitivity of the integrated risk, the operating characteristics, and the optimal sample size, to prior-data conflict. Robust analysis prior specifications, which gradually discount potentially conflicting prior information, are also included for comparison.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Patterns of cervical node metastases from squamous carcinoma of the oropharynx and hypopharynx;,citation_abstract=Abstract A retrospective review of 333 previously untreated patients from 1965 to 1986, with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or hypopharynx, was undertaken to ascertain the prevalence of neck node metastases by neck level. The 333 patients underwent 344 classical radical neck dissections. Patients were grouped by clinical neck status at the time of neck dissection: elective dissection in the NO neck (N = 71), and immediate therapeutic dissection in the N+ neck (N = 259). Detailed analysis was performed for each group based on the specific primary site. This revealed a predominance of neck node metastases in levels II, III, and IV for both oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal primaries. Isolated “skip” metastases outside of levels II, III, or IV occurred in only 1 patient (0.3%). Otherwise, level I or V involvement was always associated with nodal metastases at other levels (ie, N2 disease). These data support the trend toward selective limited neck dissection (anterior modified) in NO patients. Furthermore, they provide the foundation for planning of future prospective trials to assess the efficacy of modifications in the extent of neck dissection for carcinomas of the oropharynx or hypopharynx.;,citation_author=Frank C.

The specification of mixture posterior distributions means that the presence of k! modes is known immediately.

We show that exploration of these modes can be imposed using tempered transitions. However, if the prior distribution does not distinguish between the different components, then the posterior mixture distribution is symmetric and standard estimators such as posterior means cannot be used.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Determination and delineation of nodal target volumes for head-and-neck cancer based on patterns of failure in patients receiving definitive and postoperative IMRT;,citation_abstract=Purpose: We present the guidelines for target volume determination and delineation of head-and-neck lymph nodes based on the analysis of the patterns of nodal failure in patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Methods and Materials: Data pertaining to the natural course of nodal metastasis for each head-and-neck cancer subsite were reviewed. A system was established to provide guidance for nodal target volume determination and delineation. Following these guidelines, 126 patients (52 definitive, 74 postoperative) were treated between February 1997 and December 2000 with IMRT for head-and-neck cancer. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 12–55), and the patterns of nodal failure were analyzed. Results: These guidelines define the nodal target volume based on the location of the primary tumor and the probability of microscopic metastasis to the ipsilateral and contralateral (Level I–V) nodal regions. Following these guidelines, persistent or recurrent nodal disease was found in 6 (12%) of 52 patients receiving definitive IMRT, and 7 (9%) of 74 patients receiving postoperative IMRT had failure in the nodal region. Conclusion: On the basis of our clinical experience in implementing inverse-planning IMRT for head-and-neck cancer, we present guidelines using a simplified, but clinically relevant, method for nodal target volume determination and delineation. The intention was to provide a foundation that enables different institutions to exchange clinical experiences in head-and-neck IMRT. These guidelines will be subject to future refinement when the clinical experience in head-and-neck IMRT advances.;,citation_author=K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Adaptive fractionation therapy: II. Biological effective dose;,citation_abstract=Radiation therapy is fractionized to differentiate the cell killing between the tumor and organ at risk (OAR). Conventionally, fractionation is done by dividing the total dose into equal fraction sizes. However, as the relative positions (configurations) between OAR and the tumor vary from fractions to fractions, intuitively, we want to use a larger fraction size when OAR and the tumor are far apart and a smaller fraction size when OAR and the tumor are close to each other. Adaptive fractionation accounts for variations of configurations between OAR and the tumor. In part I of this series, the adaptation minimizes the OAR (physical) dose and maintains the total tumor (physical) dose. In this work, instead, the adaptation is based on the biological effective dose (BED). Unlike the linear programming approach in part I, we build a fraction size lookup table using mathematical induction. The lookup table essentially describes the fraction size as a function of the remaining tumor BED, the OAR/tumor dose ratio and the remaining number of fractions. The lookup table is calculated by maximizing the expected survival of OAR and preserving the tumor cell kill. Immediately before the treatment of each fraction, the OAR-tumor configuration and thus the dose ratio can be obtained from the daily setup image, and then the fraction size can be determined by the lookup table. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with the conventional fractionation method.;,citation_author=Mingli Chen;,citation_author=Weiguo Lu;,citation_author=Quan Chen;,citation_author=Kenneth Ruchala;,citation_author=Gustavo Olivera;,citation_publication_date=2008-10;,citation_cover_date=2008-10;,citation_year=2008;,citation_issue=19;,citation_doi=10.1088/0031-9155/53/19/016;,citation_issn=0031-9155, 1361-6560;,citation_volume=53;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Physics in Medicine and Biology;,citation_publisher=IOP Publishing;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Unilateral radiotherapy for the treatment of tonsil cancer;,citation_abstract=PURPOSE: To assess, through a retrospective review, clinical outcomes of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil treated at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center with unilateral radiotherapy techniques that irradiate the involved tonsil region and ipsilateral neck only. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Of 901 patients with newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil treated with radiotherapy at our institution, we identified 102 that were treated using unilateral radiotherapy techniques. All patients had their primary site of disease restricted to the tonsillar fossa or anterior pillar, with $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$1 cm involvement of the soft palate. Patients had TX (n = 17 patients), T1 (n = 52), or T2 (n = 33) disease, with Nx (n = 3), N0 (n = 33), N1 (n = 23), N2a (n = 21), or N2b (n = 22) neck disease. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (60%) underwent diagnostic tonsillectomy before radiotherapy. Twenty-seven patients (26%) underwent excision of a cervical lymph node or neck dissection before radiotherapy. Median follow-up for surviving patients was 38 months. Locoregional control at the primary site and ipsilateral neck was 100%. Two patients experienced contralateral nodal recurrence (2%). The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 95% and 96%, respectively. The 5-year freedom from contralateral nodal recurrence rate was 96%. Nine patients required feeding tubes during therapy. Of the 2 patients with contralateral recurrence, 1 experienced an isolated neck recurrence and was salvaged with contralateral neck dissection only and remains alive and free of disease. The other patient presented with a contralateral base of tongue tumor and involved cervical lymph node, which may have represented a second primary tumor, and died of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral radiotherapy for patients with TX-T2, N0-N2b primary tonsil carcinoma results in high rates of disease control, with low rates of contralateral nodal failure and a low incidence of acute toxicity requiring gastrostomy.;,citation_author=Gregory M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Estimation in large cross random-effect models by data augmentation;,citation_abstract=Summary Estimation in mixed linear models is, in general, computationally demanding, since applied problems may involve extensive data sets and large numbers of random effects. Existing computer algorithms are slow and/or require large amounts of memory. These problems are compounded in generalized linear mixed models for categorical data, since even approximate methods involve fitting of a linear mixed model within steps of an iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm. Only in models in which the random effects are hierarchically nested can the computations for fitting these models to large data sets be carried out rapidly. We describe a data augmentation approach to these computational difficulties in which we repeatedly fit an overlapping series of submodels, incorporating the missing terms in each submodel as “offsets”. The submodels are chosen so that they have a nested random-effect structure, thus allowing maximum exploitation of the computational efficiency which is available in this case. Examples of the use of the algorithm for both metric and discrete responses are discussed, all calculations being carried out using macros within the MLwiN program.;,citation_author=David Clayton;,citation_author=J.

In this phase II trial, treatment volumes were reduced by omitting PORT to the pathologically negative (PN0) neck in patients with primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who underwent surgical resection and neck dissection with a PN0 neck and high-risk features mandating PORT to the primary and/or involved neck were eligible. The primary end point was greater than 90% disease control in the unirradiated neck. QOL was evaluated using the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory and the University of Michigan patient-reported xerostomia questionnaire. RESULTS Seventy-three patients were enrolled, and 72 were evaluable. Median age was 56 years (range, 31 to 81 years); 58 patients were male, and 47 (65%) had a smoking history. Sites included oral cavity (n = 14), oropharynx (n = 37), hypopharynx (n = 4), larynx (n = 16), and unknown primary tumor (n = 1). According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual (7 th edition), 67 patients (93%) had stage III/IV disease, and 71% of tumors involved or crossed midline. No patient had contralateral neck PORT. In 17 patients (24%), only the primary site was treated. At a median follow-up of 53 months, two patients experienced treatment failure of the PN0 unirradiated neck; they also experienced treatment failure locally. Unirradiated neck control was 97% (95% CI, 93.4% to 100.0%). Five-year rates of local control, regional control, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 84%, 93%, 60%, and 64%, respectively. QOL measures were not significantly different from baseline at 12 and 24 months post-PORT ( P $&amp;amp;amp;gt;$ .05).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Elective versus Therapeutic Neck Dissection in Node-Negative Oral Cancer;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Whether patients with early-stage oral cancers should be treated with elective neck dissection at the time of the primary surgery or with therapeutic neck dissection after nodal relapse has been a matter of debate. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we evaluated the effect on survival of elective node dissection (ipsilateral neck dissection at the time of the primary surgery) versus therapeutic node dissection (watchful waiting followed by neck dissection for nodal relapse) in patients with lateralized stage T1 or T2 oral squamous-cell carcinomas. Primary and secondary end points were overall survival and disease-free survival, respectively. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2014, a total of 596 patients were enrolled. As prespecified by the data and safety monitoring committee, this report summarizes results for the first 500 patients (245 in the elective-surgery group and 255 in the therapeutic-surgery group), with a median follow-up of 39 months. There were 81 recurrences and 50 deaths in the elective-surgery group and 146 recurrences and 79 deaths in the therapeutic-surgery group. At 3 years, elective node dissection resulted in an improved rate of overall survival (80.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 74.1 to 85.8), as compared with therapeutic dissection (67.5%; 95% CI, 61.0 to 73.9), for a hazard ratio for death of 0.64 in the elective-surgery group (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.92; P=0.01 by the log-rank test). At that time, patients in the elective-surgery group also had a higher rate of disease-free survival than those in the therapeutic-surgery group (69.5% vs. 45.9%, P$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$0.001). Elective node dissection was superior in most subgroups without significant interactions. Rates of adverse events were 6.6% and 3.6% in the elective-surgery group and the therapeutic-surgery group, respectively.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A model to predict nodal metastasis in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma;,citation_abstract=Difficulty in precise decision making on necessity of surgery is a major problem when managing oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) with clinically negative neck. Therefore, use of clinical and histopathological parameters in combination would be important to improve patient management. The main objective is to develop a model that predicts the presence of nodal metastasis in patients with OSCC.623 patients faced neck dissections with buccal mucosal or tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were selected from patients’ records. Demographic data, clinical information, nodal status, Depth of invasion (DOI) and pattern of invasion (POI) were recorded. The parameters which showed a significant association with nodal metastasis were used to develop a multivariable predictive model (PM). Univariate logistic regression was used to estimate the strengths of those associations in terms of odds ratios (OR). This showed statistically significant associations between status of the nodal metastasis and each of the following 4 histopathological parameters individually: size of the tumour (T), site, POI, and DOI. Specifically, OR of nodal metastasis for tongue cancers relative to buccal mucosal cancers was 1.89, P-value $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001. Similarly, ORs for POI type 3 and 4 relative to type 2 were 1.99 and 5.83 respectively. A similar relationship was found with tumour size; ORs for T2, T3, and T4 compared to T1 were 2.79, 8.27 and 8.75 respectively. These four histopathological parameters were then used to develop a predictive model for nodal metastasis. This model showed that probability of nodal metastasis is higher among tongue cancers with increasing POI, with increasing T, and with larger depths while other characteristics remained unchanged. The proposed model provides a way of using combinations of histopathological parameters to identify patients with higher risks of nodal metastasis for surgical management.;,citation_author=R. K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=SPECT/CT-guided elective nodal irradiation for head and neck cancer is oncologically safe and less toxic: A potentially practice-changing approach;,citation_abstract=Background and purpose: Bilateral elective nodal irradiation (ENI) remains the standard treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Unilateral ENI could reduce treatment toxicity and improve health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL). This prospective proof-of-principle trial (NCT02572661) investigated the feasibility, safety and clinical benefits of SPECT/CT-guided ENI of the node-negative contralateral neck. Materials and methods: Patients with lateralized T1-3N0-2bM0 HNSCC of the oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx and hypopharynx underwent SPECT/CT after peritumoral 99mTc-nanocolloid injection. Patients without contralateral lymph drainage received ipsilateral ENI only. If lymph drainage to only one contralateral hot spot was visible, ENI to the contralateral neck would be limited to only the level containing the hot spot. The primary endpoint was the incidence of contralateral regional failure (CRF) at 2 years. Toxicity and HRQOL were compared with a 1:1 matched historical cohort that received standard bilateral ENI (B-ENI) with identical planning and treatment techniques. Results: Fifty patients were treated with SPECT/CT-guided ENI. After a median follow-up of 33 months (range 18–45), CRF was observed in one patient (2%; 95% confidence interval: 0–6%). Compared to the matched B-ENI group, patients treated with SPECT/CT-guided ENI had significantly lower incidences of grade !2 dysphagia (54% vs. 82%; p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001), tube feeding (10% vs. 50%; p $&amp;lt;$ 0.001) and late grade !2 xerostomia (9% vs. 54%; p $<$ 0.001). Significant and clinically relevant HRQOL benefits of SPECT/CTguided ENI were observed on the EORTC QLQ-C30 summary score, and QLQ-HN35 swallowing and dry mouth subscales. Conclusion: SPECT/CT-guided ENI is associated with a low risk of contralateral regional failure. Compared to B-ENI, SPECT/CT-guided ENI significantly reduces dysphagia, feeding tube placement, and late xerostomia and improves HRQOL.;,citation_author=Pieter D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Bayes factors;,citation_abstract=Abstract In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: $\bullet$ From Jeffreys’ Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. $\bullet$ Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. $\bullet$ Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. $\bullet$ Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. $\bullet$ Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. $\bullet$ In “nonstandard” statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests. $\bullet$ The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. $\bullet$ When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. $\bullet$ Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. $\bullet$ Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. $\bullet$ It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.;,citation_author=Robert E.

After fixation in 10% formalin, the specimen was imaged on a 7 Tesla MRI scanner at 100 m isotropic resolution using a custom-built 31-channel receive array coil. Single-echo multi-flip Fast Low-Angle SHot (FLASH) data were acquired over 100 hours of scan time (25 hours per flip angle), allowing derivation of synthesized FLASH volumes. This dataset provides an unprecedented view of the three-dimensional neuroanatomy of the human brain. To optimize the utility of this resource, we warped the dataset into standard stereotactic space.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Intensity-modulated radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: Emphasis on the selection and delineation of the targets;,citation_abstract=The head and neck contain many critical, noninvolved structures in close vicinity to the targets. The tightly conformal doses produced by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and the lack of internal organ motion in the head and neck, provide the potential for organ sparing and improved tumor irradiation. Many studies of treatment planning for head and neck cancer have demonstrated the dosimetric superiority of IMRT over conventional techniques in these respects. The initial results of clinical studies demonstrate reduced xerostomia. They suggest an improvement in tumor control, which needs to be verified in larger studies and longer follow-up. Critical issues for successful outcome of head and neck IMRT are accurate selection of the neck lymph nodes that require adjuvant treatment, and accurate delineation on the planning computed tomography (CT) of the lymph-node bearing areas and subclinical disease adjoining the gross tumor.

The presence or absence of HPV oncogenic types in tumors was determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization. Two-year overall and progression-free survival for HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients were estimated by Kaplan–Meier analysis. The relative hazard of mortality and progression for HPV-positive vs HPV-negative patients after adjustment for age, ECOG performance status, stage, and other covariables was estimated by use of a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. All statistical tests were two-sided. Genomic DNA of oncogenic HPV types 16, 33, or 35 was located within tumor cell nuclei of 40% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 30% to 50%) of patients with HNSCC of the oropharynx or larynx by in situ hybridization and PCR. Compared with patients with HPV-negative tumors, patients with HPV-positive tumors had higher response rates after induction chemotherapy (82% vs 55%, difference = 27%, 95% CI = 9.3% to 44.7%, P = .01) and after chemoradiation treatment (84% vs 57%, difference = 27%, 95% CI = 9.7% to 44.3%, P = .007).

This paper reviews the sources and methods used in compiling the cancer statistics in 185 countries. The validity of the national estimates depends upon the representativeness of the source information, and to take into account possible sources of bias, uncertainty intervals are now provided for the estimated sex- and site-specific all-ages number of new cancer cases and cancer deaths. We briefly describe the key results globally and by world region. There were an estimated 18.1 million (95% UI: 17.5–18.7 million) new cases of cancer (17 million excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million (95% UI: 9.3–9.8 million) deaths from cancer (9.5 million excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) worldwide in 2018. , What’s new?

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Elective management of the neck in oral cavity squamous carcinoma: Current concepts supported by prospective studies;,citation_abstract=The incidence of occult cervical metastasis in oral cavity cancer, even in early stages, is significant, necessitating elective treatment of the neck in a majority of cases. There is no method of imaging or other examination that will detect microscopic foci of metastatic disease in cervical lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical and molecular analysis of neck specimens reveals the incidence of occult metastases to be higher than revealed by light microscopy with ordinary hematoxylin and eosin staining. The neck may be treated electively by surgery or irradiation. Surgery has the advantage of permitting pathological staging of the neck, avoiding unnecessary radiation treatment and indicating cases where adjuvant therapy should be employed. As oral cavity cancer rarely metastasizes to level V, a radical or modified radical neck dissection of all five node levels is not necessary. Selective dissection of levels I–III (“supraomohyoid neck dissection”) is the usual procedure of choice for elective dissection of the neck. Most of the relatively small number of isolated metastasis to level IV are from primary tumours of the tongue, which are known to produce “skip” metastases. Thus an “extended supraomohyoid neck dissection” of levels I–IV is recommended by some authors for elective treatment of the neck in tongue cancer. A number of recent prospective multi-institutional studies have demonstrated that sublevel IIB is rarely involved with isolated metastasis from oral cavity primary tumours, except from some tongue cancers. Thus it is justifiable to omit dissection of sublevel IIB in elective treatment of most cases of oral cavity cancer. Bilateral neck dissection should be performed in elective treatment of tumours involving midline structures, and in patients with ipsilateral neck metastasis.;,citation_author=Alfio Ferlito;,citation_author=Carl E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=On the marginal likelihood and cross-validation;,citation_abstract=In Bayesian statistics, the marginal likelihood, also known as the evidence, is used to evaluate model fit as it quantifies the joint probability of the data under the prior. In contrast, non-Bayesian models are typically compared using cross-validation on held-out data, either through $k$-fold partitioning or leave-$p$-out subsampling. We show that the marginal likelihood is formally equivalent to exhaustive leave-$p$-out cross-validation averaged over all values of $p$ and all held-out test sets when using the log posterior predictive probability as the scoring rule. Moreover, the log posterior predictive is the only coherent scoring rule under data exchangeability. This offers new insight into the marginal likelihood and cross-validation and highlights the potential sensitivity of the marginal likelihood to the choice of the prior. We suggest an alternative approach using cumulative cross-validation following a preparatory training phase.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Comparison of Different Graphs in Hidden Markov Models Describing Lymphatic Spread of Head and Neck Cancer;,citation_abstract=The use of hidden Markov models (HMM) allows to describe the progression of cancer from the primary tumor to various lymph node levels (LNLs) for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Thus far the choice of lymphatic channels to describe the spread of the cancer cells has been mostly anatomically motivated. This work uses a data-driven approach to compare different choices of edges in the graph of the model. The logarithm of the marginal likelihood and the associated Bayes factor are adopted as the means for this comparison. In addition, the probability of metastases in different LNLs according to the HMM graph is compared with the prevalence in the data set. This is to further investigate the importance of individual connections. The results indicate that the anatomically motivated graph describes the data comparatively well due to the important connection between LNL II and I. Further improvement is suggested by introducing a link between LNL III and V.;,citation_author=Luca Franceschetti;,citation_publication_date=2022-08;,citation_cover_date=2022-08;,citation_year=2022;,citation_language=en-US;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Long-term regional control and survival in patients with “low-risk,” early stage oral tongue cancer managed by partial glossectomy and neck dissection without postoperative radiation;,citation_abstract=Abstract BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of locoregional failure in patients with low-risk, early stage oral tongue squamous cell cancer (OTSCC) who undergo partial glossectomy and ipsilateral elective neck dissection without receiving postoperative radiation. METHODS: A combined database of patients with OTSCC who received treatment at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Princess Margaret Cancer Center from 1985 to 2005 was established. In total, 164 patients with pathologic T1-T2N0 OTSCC who underwent partial glossectomy and ipsilateral elective neck dissection without postoperative radiation were identified. Patient-related, tumor-related, and treatment-related characteristics were recorded. Local recurrence-free survival, regional recurrence-free survival, and disease-specific survival were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Predictors of outcome were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 66 months (range 1-171 months), the 5-year rates of local recurrence-free survival, regional recurrence-free survival, and disease-specific survival were 89%, 79.9%, and 85.6%, respectively. Regional recurrence was ipsilateral in 61% of patients and contralateral in 39% of patients. The regional recurrence rate was 5.7% for tumors $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$4 mm and 24% for tumors $\geq$4 mm. Multivariate analysis indicated that tumor thickness was the only independent predictor of neck failure (regional recurrence-free survival, 94% vs 72% [ P = .02] for tumors $&amp;lt;$4 mm vs $\geq$4 mm, respectively). Patients who developed recurrence in the neck had a significantly poorer disease-specific survival compared with those who did not (33% vs 97%; P $<$ .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low-risk, pathologic T1-T2N0 OTSCC had a greater than expected rate of neck failure, with contralateral recurrence accounting for close to 40% of recurrences.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Simulating Normalizing Constants: From Importance Sampling to Bridge Sampling to Path Sampling;,citation_abstract=Computing (ratios of) normalizing constants of probability models is a fundamental computational problem for many statistical and scientific studies. Monte Carlo simulation is an effective technique, especially with complex and high-dimensional models. This paper aims to bring to the attention of general statistical audiences of some effective methods originating from theoretical physics and at the same time to explore these methods from a more statistical perspective, through establishing theoretical connections and illustrating their uses with statistical problems. We show that the acceptance ratio method and thermodynamic integration are natural generalizations of importance sampling, which is most familiar to statistical audiences. The former generalizes importance sampling through the use of a single &amp;amp;amp;quot;bridge&amp;quot; density and is thus a case of bridge sampling in the sense of Meng and Wong. Thermodynamic integration, which is also known in the numerical analysis literature as Ogata’s method for high-dimensional integration, corresponds to the use of infinitely many and continuously connected bridges (and thus a &quot;path&quot;). Our path sampling formulation offers more flexibility and thus potential efficiency to thermodynamic integration, and the search of optimal paths turns out to have close connections with the Jeffreys prior density and the Rao and Hellinger distances between two densities. We provide an informative theoretical example as well as two empirical examples (involving 17- to 70-dimensional integrations) to illustrate the potential and implementation of path sampling. We also discuss some open problems.;,citation_author=Andrew Gelman;,citation_author=Xiao-Li Meng;,citation_publication_date=1998;,citation_cover_date=1998;,citation_year=1998;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2676756;,citation_issue=2;,citation_issn=0883-4237;,citation_volume=13;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Statistical Science;,citation_publisher=Institute of Mathematical Statistics;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evidence for a Causal Association Between Human Papillomavirus and a Subset of Head and Neck Cancers;,citation_abstract=Background: High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are etiologic agents for anogenital tract cancers and have been detected in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). We investigated, retrospectively, an etiologic role for HPVs in a large series of patients with HNSCC. Methods: Tumor tissues from 253 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent HNSCC were tested for the presence of HPV genome by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays, Southern blot hybridization, and in situ hybridization. The viral E6 coding region was sequenced to confirm the presence of tumor-specific viral isolates. Exons 5-9 of the TP53 gene were sequenced from 166 specimens. The hazard of death from HNSCC in patients with and without HPVpositive tumors was determined by proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: HPV was detected in 62 (25%) of 253 cases (95% confidence interval [CI] = 19%-30%). Highrisk, tumorigenic type HPV16 was identified in 90% of the HPV-positive tumors. HPV16 was localized specifically by in situ hybridization within the nuclei of cancer cells in preinvasive, invasive, and lymph node disease. Southern blot hybridization patterns were consistent with viral integration. Poor tumor grade (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.2- 4.9) and oropharyngeal site (OR = 6.2; 95% CI = 3.1-12.1) independently increased the probability of HPV presence. As compared with HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers, HPVpositive oropharyngeal cancers were less likely to occur among moderate to heavy drinkers (OR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.05-0.61) and smokers (OR = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.02-1.4), had a characteristic basaloid morphology (OR = 18.7; 95% CI = 2.1-167), were less likely to have TP53 mutations (OR = 0.06; 95% CI = 0.01-0.36), and had improved disease-specific survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.07-0.98). After adjustment for the presence of lymph node disease (HR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.4- 3.8), heavy alcohol consumption (HR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.4-4.7), and age greater than 60 years old (HR = 1.4; 95% CI = 0.8-2.3), all patients with HPV-positive tumors had a 59% reduction in risk of death from cancer when compared with HPV-negative HNSCC patients (HR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.20-0.88). Conclusions: These data extend recent molecular and epidemiologic studies and strongly suggest that HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers comprise a distinct molecular, clinical, and pathologic disease entity that is likely causally associated with HPV infection and that has a markedly improved prognosis.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Developmental fluoride neurotoxicity: An updated review;,citation_abstract=Abstract Background After the discovery of fluoride as a caries-preventing agent in the mid-twentieth century, fluoridation of community water has become a widespread intervention, sometimes hailed as a mainstay of modern public health. However, this practice results in elevated fluoride intake and has become controversial for two reasons. First, topical fluoride application in the oral cavity appears to be a more direct and appropriate means of preventing caries. Second, systemic fluoride uptake is suspected of causing adverse effects, in particular neurotoxicity during early development. The latter is supported by experimental neurotoxicity findings and toxicokinetic evidence of fluoride passing into the brain. Method An integrated literature review was conducted on fluoride exposure and intellectual disability, with a main focus on studies on children published subsequent to a meta-analysis from 2012. Results Fourteen recent cross-sectional studies from endemic areas with naturally high fluoride concentrations in groundwater supported the previous findings of cognitive deficits in children with elevated fluoride exposures. Three recent prospective studies from Mexico and Canada with individual exposure data showed that early-life exposures were negatively associated with children’s performance on cognitive tests. Neurotoxicity appeared to be dose-dependent, and tentative benchmark dose calculations suggest that safe exposures are likely to be below currently accepted or recommended fluoride concentrations in drinking water. Conclusion The recent epidemiological results support the notion that elevated fluoride intake during early development can result in IQ deficits that may be considerable. Recognition of neurotoxic risks is necessary when determining the safety of fluoride-contaminated drinking water and fluoride uses for preventive dentistry purposes.;,citation_author=Philippe Grandjean;,citation_publication_date=2019-12;,citation_cover_date=2019-12;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/s12940-019-0551-x;,citation_issn=1476-069X;,citation_volume=18;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Environmental Health;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=CT-based delineation of lymph node levels and related CTVs in the node-negative neck: DAHANCA, EORTC, GORTEC, NCIC,RTOG consensus guidelines;,citation_abstract=Background and purpose: The appropriate application of 3-D CRT and IMRT for HNSCC requires a standardization of the procedures for the delineation of the target volumes. Over the past few years, two proposals—the so-called Brussels guidelines from Grégoire et al., and the so-called Rotterdam guidelines from Nowak et al.—emerged from the literature for the delineation of the neck node levels. Detailed examination of these proposals however revealed some important discrepancies. Materials and methods: Within this framework, the Brussels and Rotterdam groups decided to review their guidelines and derive a common set of recommendations for delineation of neck node levels. This proposal was then discussed with representatives of major cooperative groups in Europe (DAHANCA, EORTC, GORTEC) and in North America (NCIC, RTOG), which, after some additional refinements, have endorsed them. The objective of the present article is to present the consensus guidelines for the delineation of the node levels in the node-negative neck. Results and conclusions: First a short discussion of the discrepancies between the previous Brussels and the Rotterdam guidelines is presented. The general philosophy of the consensus guidelines and the methodology used to resolve the various discrepancies are then described. The consensus proposal is then presented and representative CTVs that are consistent with these guidelines are illustrated on CT sections.

DAHANCA, EORTC, HKNPCSG, NCIC CTG, NCRI, RTOG, TROG consensus guidelines;,citation_abstract=In 2003, a panel of experts published a set of consensus guidelines for the delineation of the neck node levels in node negative patients (Radiother Oncol, 69: 227–36, 2003). In 2006, these guidelines were extended to include the characteristics of the node positive and the post-operative neck (Radiother Oncol, 79: 15–20, 2006). These guidelines did not fully address all nodal regions and some of the anatomic descriptions were ambiguous, thereby limiting consistent use of the recommendations. In this framework, a task force comprising opinion leaders in the field of head and neck radiation oncology from European, Asian, Australia/New Zealand and North American clinical research organizations was formed to review and update the previously published guidelines on nodal level delineation. Based on the nomenclature proposed by the American Head and Neck Society and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and in alignment with the TNM atlas for lymph nodes in the neck, 10 node groups (some being divided into several levels) were defined with a concise description of their main anatomic boundaries, the normal structures juxtaposed to these nodes, and the main tumor sites at risk for harboring metastases in those levels. Emphasis was placed on those levels not adequately considered previously (or not addressed at all); these included the lower neck (e.g. supraclavicular nodes), the scalp (e.g. retroauricular and occipital nodes), and the face (e.g. buccal and parotid nodes). Lastly, peculiarities pertaining to the node-positive and the post-operative clinical scenarios were also discussed. In conclusion, implementation of these guidelines in the daily practice of radiation oncology should contribute to the reduction of treatment variations from clinician to clinician and facilitate the conduct of multi-institutional clinical trials.;,citation_author=Vincent Grégoire;,citation_author=Kian Ang;,citation_author=Wilfried Budach;,citation_author=Cai Grau;,citation_author=Marc Hamoir;,citation_author=Johannes A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Proposal for the delineation of the nodal CTV in the node-positive and the post-operative neck;,citation_abstract=Background and purpose In 2003, a panel of experts published a set of consensus guidelines regarding the delineation of the neck node levels (Radiother Oncol, 2003; 69: 227–36). These recommendations were applicable for the node-negative and the N1-neck, but were found too restrictive for the node-positive and the post-operative neck. Patients and methods In this framework, using the previous recommendations as a backbone, new guidelines have been proposed taking into account the specificities of the node-positive and the post-operative neck. Results Inclusion of the retrostyloid space cranially and the supra-clavicular fossa caudally is proposed in case of neck nodes (defined radiologically or on the surgical specimen) located in levels II, and IV or Vb, respectively. When extra-capsular rupture is suspected (on imaging) or demonstrated on the pathological specimen, adjacent muscles should also be included in the CTV. For node(s) located at the boundary between contiguous levels (e.g. levels II and Ib), these two levels should be delineated. In the post-operative setting, the entire “surgical bed” should be included. Last, the retropharyngeal space should be delineated in case of positive neck from pharyngeal tumors. Conclusions The objective of the manuscript is to give a comprehensive description of the new set of guidelines for CTV delineation in the node-positive neck and the post-operative neck, with a complementary atlas of the new anatomical structures to be included.;,citation_author=Vincent Grégoire;,citation_author=Avraham Eisbruch;,citation_author=Marc Hamoir;,citation_author=Peter Levendag;,citation_publication_date=2006-04;,citation_cover_date=2006-04;,citation_year=2006;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.radonc.2006.03.009;,citation_issn=01678140;,citation_volume=79;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Radiotherapy and Oncology;">

We see how Pathfinder uses a belief network to construct differential diagnosis efficiently, even when there are dependencies among pieces of evidence. In addition, we introduce an extension of the belief-network representation called a similarity network, a tool for constructing large and complex belief networks. The representation allows a user to construct independent belief networks for subsets of a given domain. A valid belief network for the entire domain can then be constructed from the individual belief networks. We also introduce the partition, a graphical representation that facilitates the assessment of probabilities associated with a belief network. We show that the similarity-network and partition representations made practical the construction of Pathfinder.;,citation_author=E. D. Heckerman;,citation_author=N. B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Decision making in the management of recurrent head and neck cancer;,citation_abstract=Despite substantial improvements in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treatment, the major obstacle to long-term survival remains disease recurrence. Salvage options are often limited due to prior therapy and the escalated morbidity of retreatment. The costs of treatment must be measured against the anticipated quality and quantity of life recovered, even with resectable disease. This review surveys the recurrent HNSCC literature to better guide decision making. Across multiple studies, negative prognostic factors include impaired performance status, advanced recurrent stage, brief disease-free interval, previous chemotherapy, and nonlaryngeal sites of recurrence. When possible, surgical salvage remains the principal option for durable disease control, quality of life preservation, and cure. Nonsurgical therapies have also demonstrated measurable improvements in locoregional control. Interpretation of salvage literature must be tempered by recognition of significant selection bias. The decision for salvage therapy must be individualized, with management that involves well-informed patients resulting in the best outcomes. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Patterns of regional lymph node metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A meta-analysis of clinical evidence;,citation_abstract=Background: The characteristics of cervical lymphatic metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are not completely understood. As such, radiotherapy to the entire lymphatic of the neck bilaterally has been empirically practiced even in early stage disease, although not supported by clinical evidence. We studied the pattern and probability of nodal metastasis through a meta-analysis of published evidences, with an aim to establish an evidence-based guideline for selecting and delineation of clinical target volume of neck lymphatics for conformation radiation for NPC. Methods: A literature search yielded an initial 411 original articles, and 13 studies with 2920 NPC cases staged via MRI were included in this analysis. The occurrence of nodal metastasis was calculated and analyzed according to the respective regional nodal levels. Results: 85% of NPC cases presented with lymphadenopathy. The most commonly involved regions include retropharyngeal (69%) and level II lymph nodes (70%). The overall probability of levels III, IV, and V nodal involvement are 45%, 11%, and 27%, respectively. Low-risk node groups included the supraclavicular, levels IA/IB and VI nodes, and parotid nodes with involvement rates at 3%, 0%, 3%, 0%, and 1%, respectively. Nodal metastases followed an orderly pattern and the probability of “skip” metastasis between levels varied between 0.5-7.9%. Conclusions: Lymph node metastasis in NPC follows a predictable and orderly pattern. The rarity of metastasis in certain nodal groups and “skip” metastasis suggest that reduced treatment volume is feasible in conformal radiotherapy for NPC.;,citation_author=Francis Ch Ho;,citation_author=Ivan Wk Tham;,citation_author=Arul Earnest;,citation_author=Khai Mun Lee;,citation_author=Jiade J Lu;,citation_publication_date=2012-12;,citation_cover_date=2012-12;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/1471-2407-12-98;,citation_issn=1471-2407;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=BMC Cancer;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Detailed analysis of lymphatic progression patterns for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma;,citation_abstract=Purpose/Objective: Head &amp;amp;amp; neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) spread lymphatically through the neck and form metastases in regional lymph nodes. While the general directions of spread are understood and the prevalence of lymph node level (LNL) involvement has been reported, the details of lymphatic progression patterns are insufficiently quantified. Purpose of this study is to investigate, how the risk of metastases in a given level depends on whether or not upstream levels harbour metastases, how much the risk increases for late versus early T-stage, and if progression patterns differ between HPV positive versus negative tumors. Quantifying these dependencies may eventually lead to more personalized definition of the elective nodal CTV and tailored radiotherapy treatments. Materials/Methods: To address these questions, we retrospectively analysed all patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal HNSCC treated at our institution between 2013 and 2019, resulting in a dataset of 287 patients. For all patients, involvement of LNLs I-IIV was recorded together with T-stage, midline extension, HPV status, smoking status, and primary tumor subsite. Using common criteria , LNL involvement was assessed individually based on available modalities (PET, MR, CT, FNA). To analyse the complex dataset, a graphical user interface linked to an SQL database was developed, which allows querying the number of patients with a certain combination of co-involved LNLs and tumor characteristics (Figure 1). Results: Table 1 reports the number of patients in whom a particular combination of LNLs was involved to highlighted selected findings: 1) Ipsilateral level IV was involved in 27% of patients in whom level II and III were involved, but only in 2% of patients in whom level II but not III is involved. 2) Prevalence of involvement of ipsilateral levels II, III, IV, V was 79%, 34%, 7%, 3% for early T-stage patients (T1/T2) and 85%, 50%, 17%, 9% for late T-stage (T3/T4), quantifying increasing involvement with T-stage especially for the more downstream levels. 3) Contralateral levels II, III, IV were involved in 41%, 19%, 4% for tumors with midline extension and 12%, 3%, 2% for tumors without midline extension. 4) The dataset provided no indication that LNL involvement is different for HPV positive vs negative tumors. 5 ) Ipsilateral level VII was involved in 10% of all patients and in 14% and 6% of patients with primary tumors in the tonsil and the base of tongue, respectively. Conclusions: Detailed reporting and quantification of LNL involvement in HNSCC depending on involvement of upstream LNLs, T-stage, primary tumor subsite, midline extension, and potential other risk factors may allow for further personalization of CTV-N definition and reduced toxicity in the future.

Methods and Materials Patients with T1-T2N0-N2b tonsillar cancer who received ipsilateral RT or bilateral RT between 1999 and 2014 were reviewed. Overall survival (OS), local control (LC), regional control (RC), and grade 3 to 4 late toxicity (LT) were compared between ipsilateral RT and bilateral RT within HPV+ and HPV- patients, separately. Results HPV status was ascertained in 379/427 (88%) consecutive patients (ipsilateral RT: 62 HPV+, 34 HPV-; bilateral RT: 240 HPV+ 240, 41 HPV-). The proportion of ipsilateral RT by N category for HPV+ and HPV- patients were as follows: N0: 24/37 (65%) versus 28/48 (74%); N1: 21/49 (43%) versus 4/9 (44%); N2a: 10/39 (26%) versus 1/4 (25%); and N2b: 7/177 (4%) versus 1/24 (4%), respectively. Of the patients receiving ipsilateral RT, 94/96 (98%) were treated with RT alone. The median follow-up time was 5.03&nbsp;years. The respective 5-year rates of OS, LC, RC, and LT were similar between ipsilateral RT and bilateral RT for the HPV+&nbsp;patients (OS: 89% vs 87%, P=.55; LC: 97% vs 98%, P=.65; RC: 98% vs 97%, P=.27; LT: 17% vs 12%, P=.83) and HPV- patients (OS: 63% vs 48%, P=.27; LC: 90% vs 80%, P=.19; RC: 94% vs 83%, P=.14; LT: 15% vs 22%, P=.36). Of the 96 patients receiving ipsilateral RT, contralateral neck failure (CNF) occurred in 1/52 HPV+&nbsp;patients and 1/34 HPV- patients. The 5-year CNF rates were 2% (95% CI: 1-9) (HPV+: 2% [0-14]; HPV-: 3% [0-21], P=.66). Five local failures (2 HPV+; 3 HPV-) and no distant failures were seen. The 5-year rates of LC, RC, and LT were 97% versus 90% (P=.24), 98% versus 94% (P=.25), and 18% versus 15% (P=.75) for the HPV+ and HPV- cohorts, respectively. Osteoradionecrosis occurred in 9 patients: 6/47 (13%) treated with conventional RT and 3/49 (6%) with intensity modulated RT (P=.32).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prescribing, recording, and reporting photon beam therapy;,citation_abstract=This Report seeks to promote the use of a common language for specifying and reporting the doses in radiation therapy, as well as the volumes in which they are prescribed. Report 50 completely supersedes and updates ICRU Report 29 (published in 1978). The different volumes, which need to be identified prior to any radiotherapy, are first defined: the gross tumour volume, and the clinical target volume and the planning target volume (PTV). The two first ones are purely oncological concepts, the third one takes into account the movement of the patient and the inaccuracies due to patient-beam positioning, and related to the therapy equipment. Examples are given on how to identify these volumes from x-ray films and CT sections. Three classes of organs at risk are also defined. A substantial part of the report is devoted to the different ways of describing the dose variation throughout the PTV and identifying the high-dose or low-dose regions. External photon beam irradiation only is considered in Report 50. As a general rule for reporting, it is recommended to identify a Reference Point where the dose can be determined accurately and can be considered to be representative of the dose distribution throughout the PTV. The dose at the point (the ICRU Reference Point) should always be reported as well as the maximum and minimum doses in the PTV. The situation is more complex when two or more PTV’s are identified: general recommendations are given. Three important appendices are added to the Report in order to help the reader apply the ICRU recommendations. Appendix I provides a list of the minimum requirements for documentation and for reporting the irradiation techniques. An anatomical code describing the different volumes is proposed. Appendix II contains 5 examples which illustrate, in detail, how to use the ICRU recommendations in practical clinical situations (tumour of the bronchus, breast, prostate, floor of the mouth and thigh). Appendix III discusses the relative merits of the ICRU Reference Point compared to the minimum and the mean doses at the PTV for reporting a therapeutic irradiation.;,citation_author=International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements;,citation_publication_date=1993;,citation_cover_date=1993;,citation_year=1993;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_technical_report_institution=International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements;,citation_technical_report_number=50;">

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of RPLN involvement upon outcomes. A single-centre retrospective analysis of 402 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma treated nonsurgically between 2010 and 2017 was performed. All had a baseline 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) PET-CT and contrast-enhanced MRI and/or CT. RPLN status was determined by radiology review of cases with reported abnormal RPLN. Multivariate backwards logistic regression was used to examine impact on outcomes of factors. Abnormal RPLNs were identified in 40/402 (10%) of patients. Median follow up was 42.9 months. RPLN involvement was associated with inferior 3 year outcomes for overall survival (OS) (67.1% vs. 79.1%, p = 0.006) and distant metastases-free survival (DMFS) (73.9% versus 88.0%, p = 0.011), with no significant difference in local control (81.6% vs. 87.7%, p = 0.154) or regional control (80.7% vs. 85.4%, p = 0.252). On multivariate analysis abnormal RPLN, no concurrent chemotherapy and ongoing smoking were associated with inferior DMFS and OS, while advanced T stage was also associated with inferior OS. In summary, RPLN involvement, present in 10% of patients, was an independent prognostic factor for the development of distant disease failure translating into inferior OS.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Imaging for Target Delineation in Head and Neck Cancer Radiotherapy;,citation_abstract=The definition of tumor involved volumes in patients with head and neck cancer poses great challenges with the increasing use of highly conformal radiotherapy techniques eg, volumetric modulated arc therapy and intensity modulated proton therapy. The risk of underdosing the tumor might increase unless great care is taken in the process. The information gained from imaging is increasing with both PET and MRI becoming readily available for the definition of targets. The information gained from these techniques is indeed multidimensional as one often acquire data on eg, metabolism, diffusion, and hypoxia together with anatomical and structural information. Nevertheless, much work remains to fully exploit the available information on a patient-specific level. Multimodality target definition in radiotherapy is a chain of processes that must be individually scrutinized, optimized and quality assured. Any uncertainties or errors in image acquisition, reconstruction, interpretation, and delineation are systematic errors and hence will potentially have a detrimental effect on the entire radiotherapy treatment and hence; the chance of cure or the risk of unnecessary side effects. Common guidelines and procedures create a common minimum standard and ground for evaluation and development. In Denmark, the treatment of head and neck cancer is organized within the multidisciplinary Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group (DAHANCA). The radiotherapy quality assurance group of DAHANCA organized a workshop in January 2020 with participants from oncology, radiology, and nuclear medicine from all centers in Denmark, treating patients with head and neck cancer. The participants agreed on a national guideline on imaging for target delineation in head and neck cancer radiotherapy, which has been approved by the DAHANCA group. The guidelines are available in the Supplementary. The use of multimodality imaging is being recommended for the planning of all radical treatments with a macroscopic tumor. 2-[18F]FDG-PET/CT should be available, preferable in the treatment position. The recommended MRI sequences are T1, T2 with and without fat suppression, and T1 with contrast enhancement, preferable in the treatment position. The interpretation of clinical information, including thorough physical examination as well as imaging, should be done in a multidisciplinary setting with an oncologist, radiologist, and nuclear medicine specialist.;,citation_author=Kenneth Jensen;,citation_author=Gina Al-Farra;,citation_author=Danijela Dejanovic;,citation_author=Jesper G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Radiation-induced Cell Death and Its Mechanisms;,citation_abstract=Abstract With rapid technical advances, ionizing radiation has been put into wider application in ordinary living, with the worst cytological effect on the human body being cell death. Moreover, according to the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death, the method of radiation-induced cell death, usually classified as interphase and proliferative death, undergoes more detailed classifications oriented by its molecular mechanism. Elaborating its mode and molecular mechanism is crucial for the protection and treatment of radiation injury, as well as the radiotherapy and recovery of tumors. Varying with the changes of the radiation dose and the environment, the diverse targets and pathways of ionizing radiation result in various cell deaths. This review focuses on classifications of radiation-induced cell death and its molecular mechanism. We also examine the main characteristics of ionizing radiation-induced cell death. The modes of radiation-induced cell death can be classified as apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy-dependent cell death, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, immunogenic cell death, and non-lethal processes. Once the dose is high enough, radiation effects mostly appear as destructiveness (“destructiveness” is used to describe a situation in which cells do not have the opportunity to undergo a routine death process, in which case high-dose radiation works like a physical attack). This breaks up or even shatters cells, making it difficult to find responses of the cell itself. Due to diversities concerning cell phenotypes, phases of cell cycle, radiation dose, and even cellular subregions, various methods of cell death occur, which are difficult to identify and classify. Additionally, the existence of common initial activation and signaling molecules among all kinds of cell deaths, as well as sophisticated crossways in cellular molecules, makes it more laborious to distinguish and classify various cell deaths.;,citation_author=Yunfei Jiao;,citation_author=Fangyu Cao;,citation_author=Hu Liu;,citation_publication_date=2022-11;,citation_cover_date=2022-11;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1097/HP.0000000000001601;,citation_issn=1538-5159, 0017-9078;,citation_pmid=36069830;,citation_volume=123;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Health Physics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma;,citation_abstract=Most head and neck cancers are derived from the mucosal epithelium in the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx and are known collectively as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Oral cavity and larynx cancers are generally associated with tobacco consumption, alcohol abuse or both, whereas pharynx cancers are increasingly attributed to infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), primarily HPV-16. Thus, HNSCC can be separated into HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC. Despite evidence of histological progression from cellular atypia through various degrees of dysplasia, ultimately leading to invasive HNSCC, most patients are diagnosed with late-stage HNSCC without a clinically evident antecedent pre-malignant lesion. Traditional staging of HNSCC using the tumour–node–metastasis system has been supplemented by the 2017 AJCC/UICC staging system, which incorporates additional information relevant to HPV-positive disease. Treatment is generally multimodal, consisting of surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for oral cavity cancers and primary CRT for pharynx and larynx cancers. The EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab is generally used in combination with radiation in HPV-negative HNSCC where comorbidities prevent the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy. The FDA approved the immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab for treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC and pembrolizumab as primary treatment for unresectable disease. Elucidation of the molecular genetic landscape of HNSCC over the past decade has revealed new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

The penultimate UICC classification suggested that neck node level was important although there was no mention of this in the most recent classification. In addition, patients with carcinomas at the various sites would be expected to have different patterns of nodal involvement. Of 3419 patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma on the Liverpool University Head and Neck Unit database, 947 had neck node metastases. The neck node levels were coded as (I)sub-mandibular, (II) above the thyroid notch, (III) below the thyroid notch and (IV) supra-clavicular/posterior triangle nodes. Levels II and III contained the deep jugular chain. The relationship between node level and site and sub-site and survival were analysed with particular emphasis on multivariate methods. The 5-year survival for the whole group was 51% and survival fell with decreasing node level (I-IV) being 37% for sub-mandibular nodes, 32% for deep cervical nodes and 25% for lower deep cervical nodes. The 18-month survival for supra-clavicular and posterior triangle nodes was 21%. The difference in survival was significant (x23= 24.42, P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that as the level of the nodes fell from the sub-mandibular refion to the supra-clavicular region the prognosis worsened (estimate = -0.3378, P = 0.0003). Level II (upper deep cervical) nodes were the most commonly involved with regards to all primary sites and formed 69% of all neck node metastases. Over three quarters of laryngeal oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal metastases went ot this level whereas only 47% of oral cancers did. Most of the remainder of these latter lesions metastasized to level I (42%). These findings were confirmed by multiple logistic regression. When studying survival for lymph node level with regard to site all sites had a reducing prognosis with decrasing node level except for larynx. Multiple linear regression showed an association between decreasing node level and increasing N-stage (P = 0.001) with increasing T-stage (P = 0.0014) and as the site moved from the mouth to the larynx (P = 0.0047). The present data support the view that neck node level is important as regards prognosis for most sites in the head and neck. The data confirm the clinical view that deep cervical nodes are most frequently affected by head and neck cancer with level IV nodes being unusual and clinically tending to herald a non head and neck tumour and that level III nodes are relatively uncommon. This is surprising as one would expect at least a proportion of laryngeal carcinomas and quite a high proportion of lhypopharyngeal carcinomas to metastasize to this region.;,citation_author=A. S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Upfront surgery versus definitive chemoradiotherapy in patients with human Papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer;,citation_abstract=Objectives: Currently, human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV-A OPC) is managed with either primary surgery or definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT), despite the lack of supporting randomized prospective data. We therefore assessed the outcomes of each treatment strategy using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Methods: The NCDB was used to identify patients diagnosed with cT1 N2a-2b or cT2 N1-2b HPV-A OPC from 2010 to 2013 who underwent treatment with primary surgery or CRT. Demographic and clinicopathologic predictors of treatment were analyzed by the chi-square test and logistic regression. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression, Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test, and propensity score-matched analysis. Results: We identified 3063 patients; 1576 (51.5%) received CRT and 1487 (48.5%) underwent primary surgery. Median follow up was 32 months. 972 (65.4%) surgical patients received adjuvant CRT. On multivariable Cox regression, 3-year OS was comparable between surgery and CRT (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83–1.41, P = 0.58). Inferior OS was significantly associated with increasing clinical T and N stage, older age, and non-private insurance. Propensity score-matching yielded a 2526 patient cohort and redemonstrated similar OS (HR, 1.09; 95% CI 0.81–1.47; P = 0.55). Comparable outcomes persisted in a subset analysis of patients with margin-negative resection, with 3-year OS 90.8% in CRT patients vs. 93.6% in surgery patients (log-rank P = 0.27). Conclusions: Upfront surgery and CRT yielded comparable 3-year OS outcomes in this cohort. In this national sample, 65.4% of surgical patients received trimodal therapy with adjuvant CRT, highlighting the need for improved patient selection for primary surgery.;,citation_author=Jacqueline R.

Materials and Methods$\quad$It is a prospective observational study. The inclusion criteria were—245 patients of carcinoma buccal mucosa, anterior two-thirds of tongue, hard palate, oral surface of soft palate, floor of mouth, vestibule, and alveolus. The exclusion criteria were—patients who had received preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy and patients with recurrent disease. Statistical Methods$\quad$All data were analyzed using SPSS 18.0 and Graphpad prism 7 software for statistical analysis. Count data have been expressed as percentages (%). The $\chi$ 2 test was used for univariate analysis of the risk factors of cervical lymph node metastasis. The odds ratio value (with 95% confidence interval) was used to express the risk of cervical lymph node metastasis. p-Value of $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$0.05 was considered as the difference with statistical significance. Results$\quad$The most common site involved was buccal mucosa. Patterned lymph node metastasis was seen in 93.5% cases. Skip metastasis was seen in 4.31% cases. Level I b was the most common site of nodal involvement for all primary subsites of oral cavity cancer. The incidence of positive nodes on histopathological analysis was highest in cases of lower alveolus (63.15%), followed by tongue. Conclusion$\quad$In our study, patterns of lymph node metastasis for oral cavity cancer were comparable to other studies with large number of subjects.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Elective Nodal Irradiation and Patterns of Failure in Head and Neck Cancer After Primary Radiation Therapy;,citation_abstract=Purpose The delineation of elective clinical target volumes in head and neck cancer (HNC) is important; however, the extent of lymph node levels necessary to include is debated. A comprehensive analysis of recurrence patterns in a large cohort of patients with HNC was performed, with an emphasis on recurrence in the retropharyngeal region and level IB. Methods and Materials From 2005 to 2012, 942 patients with oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, laryngeal or oral cavity carcinomas were curatively treated with primary radiation therapy. The median follow-up period was 34&nbsp;months, and 77% of the patients underwent intensity modulated radiation therapy. The retropharyngeal region was only routinely included in cases of involvement of the posterior pharynx wall and level IB only in cases of involvement of the oral cavity. In patients with regional recurrence, the anatomic site of the recurrence was assessed from the surgical descriptions or computed tomography scans and compared with the original radiation treatment plan (available from 2007 onward). The p16 status was available for 282 oropharynx carcinoma cases, with 65% p16-positive. Results Of the 942 patients, 376 (40%) developed recurrences: 228 (24.2%) local, 123 (13.1%) regional, and 109 (11.6%) distant. In 700 patients with available treatment plans, retropharyngeal and level IB recurrence was observed in 2 and 7 patients, respectively. Eight patients (1.1%) had recurrence in a lymph node level not included in their primary treatment plan. For oropharynx carcinoma, the locoregional control rate (90% vs 70%) but not distant control rate (92% vs 87%), was significantly better in the p16-positive than in the p16-negative patients. Although fewer recurrences developed in the p16-positive group, patients with recurrence of p16-positive tumors were more likely to develop recurrence in distant sites. Conclusions Retropharyngeal or level IB recurrence after primary HNC radiation therapy is rare. Thus, inclusion of these regions in the elective treatment volumes should be limited to patients with involvement of the posterior pharyngeal wall or oral cavity.;,citation_author=Julie Kjems;,citation_author=Anita B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Management of contralateral N0 neck in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma;,citation_abstract=Background. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and predictive factors of contralateral occult lymph node metastasis in squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity to form a rational basis for elective contralateral neck management. Methods. We performed a retrospective analysis of 66 patients with cancer of the N0–2 oral cavity undergoing elective neck dissection for contralateral clinically negative necks from 1991 to 2003. Results. Clinically negative but pathologically positive contralateral lymph nodes occurred in 11% (7 of 66). Of the 11 cases with a clinically positive ipsilateral node neck, contralateral occult lymph node metastases developed in 36% (4 of 11), in contrast with 5% (3 of 55) in the cases with clinically N0 ipsilateral necks (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .05). Based on the clinical staging of the tumor, 8% (3 of 37) of the cases showed lymph node metastases in T2 tumors, 25% (2 of 8) in T3, and 18% (2 of 11) in T4. None of the T1 tumors (10 cases) had pathologically positive lymph nodes. The rate of contralateral occult neck metastasis was significantly higher in advanced-stage cases and those crossing the midline, compared with early-stage or unilateral lesions (p $&amp;lt;$ .05). Patients with no evidence of contralateral nodal cancer had significantly improved disease-specific survival over patients with any pathologically positive nodes (5-year disease-specific survival rate was 79% vs. 43%, p $<$ .05). Conclusions. The risk of contralateral occult neck involvement in the oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas above the T3 classification or those crossing the midline with unilateral metastases was high, and patients who presented with a contralateral metastatic neck had a worse prognosis than those whose disease was staged as N0. Therefore, we advocate an elective contralateral neck treatment with surgery or radiotherapy in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma with ipsilateral node metastases or tumors, or both, whose disease is greater than T3 or crossing the midline. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=FDG PET and PET/CT;,citation_abstract=Molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) using tumour-seeking radiopharmaceuticals has gained wide acceptance in oncology with many clinical applications. The hybrid imaging modality PET/CT allows assessing molecular as well as morphologic information at the same time. Therefore, PET/CT represents an efficient tool for whole body staging and re-staging within one imaging modality. In oncology the glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most widely used PET and PET/CT radiopharmaceutical in clinical routine. FDG PET and PET/CT have been used for staging and re-staging tumour patients in numerous studies. This chapter will discuss the use and the main indications of FDG PET and PET/CT in oncology with special emphasis on lung cancer, oesophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, lymphoma and breast cancer (among other tumour entities). A review of the current literature will be given with respect to primary diagnosis, staging and diagnosis of recurrent disease (local, lymph node and distant metastases). Besides its integral role in diagnosis, staging and re-staging of disease in oncology, there is increasing evidence that FDG PET and PET/CT can significantly contribute to therapy response assessment possibly influencing therapeutic management and treatment planning, to therapy tumour control and prediction of prognosis in oncologic patients, which will also be discussed in this chapter.;,citation_author=Berud J.

This results in a complex problem with uncountable, dimension-increasing state space and an uncountable control space. We show how to approximate the solution of this dynamic programming problem using rollout, and propose rollout heuristics specifically designed for the Bayesian optimization setting. We present numerical experiments showing that the resulting algorithm for optimization with a finite budget outperforms several popular Bayesian optimization algorithms.;,citation_author=Remi R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An Infra-red Reflecting Optical Coating for Solar Cover Glass;,citation_abstract=A major problem with silicon solar cells is that they lose efficiency with increased operating temperature, at a rate of about 0.5% per 1C increase. This causes a significant reduction in power output, particularly in hot climates. A solution in the form of an optical coating is presented, which reflects infrared (IR) radiation to limit the module temperature increase. The optical coating is also anti-reflecting (AR) in the visible wavelength range, increasing the amount of light reaching the cell absorber. Modelling results show that the weighted average reflection (WAR) is reduced to 1.22% in the wavelength range associated with the band gap of silicon. The optical coating then reflects up to 70% of the infra-red. Although the model presented is based on silicon, the coating design can be modified to work with other photovoltaic technologies. The coating design uses only 4 layers and can be deposited using conventional high throughput magnetron sputtering systems already familiar to glass manufacturers. Preliminary work on optimising the coating deposition parameters is also presented here alongside modelling results. Deployment of the infra-red reflecting optical coating on solar cover glass represents a potential breakthrough in solar technology and will result in a significant increase in the power output of photovoltaic modules.;,citation_author=Adam M Law;,citation_author=Piotr M Kaminski;,citation_author=Patrick J M Isherwood;,citation_author=John Michael Walls;,citation_publication_date=2019-06;,citation_cover_date=2019-06;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.1109/PVSC40753.2019.8981269;,citation_isbn=978-1-72810-494-2;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_conference_title=2019 IEEE 46th Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC);,citation_conference=IEEE;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=UpSet: Visualization of Intersecting Sets;,citation_abstract=Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Distributions of Cervical Lymph Node Metastases in Oropharyngeal Carcinoma: Therapeutic Implications for the N0 Neck:;,citation_abstract=Abstract Objectives: This study sought to investigate the patterns and distributions of lymph node metastases in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and improve the rationale for elective treatment of N0 neck. Materials and Methods: One hundred four patients with oropharyngeal SCC who underwent neck dissection between 1992 and 2003 were analyzed retrospectively. All patients had curative surgery as their initial treatment for the primary tumor and neck. A total of 161 neck dissections on both sides of the neck were performed. Therapeutic dissections were done in 71 and 5 necks and elective neck dissection was done on 33 and 52 necks on the ipsilateral and contralateral sides, respectively. Surgical treatment was followed by postoperative radiotherapy for 78 patients. The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 96 months (mean, 30 months). Results: Of the 161 neck dissection specimens evaluated, 90 (56%) necks were found to have lymph node metastases found by pathologic examination. These consisted of 76 (73% of 104 necks) of the ipsilateral side and 14 (25% of 57 necks) of the contralateral side dissections. The occult metastatic rate was 24% (8 of 33) of ipsilateral neck samples and 21% (11 of 52) of contralateral neck samples. Of the 68 patients who had a therapeutic dissection on the ipsilateral side and had lymphatic metastasis, the incidence rate of level IV and level I metastasis was 37% (25 of 68) and 10% (7 of 68), respectively. Isolated metastasis to level IV occurred on the ipsilateral side in three patients. There were no cases of isolated ipsilateral level I pathologic involvement in an N-positive neck or occult metastasis to this group. The incidence rate of level IV metastasis in patients with ipsilateral nodal metastasis was significantly higher in base of tongue cancer (86% [6 of 7]) compared with tonsillar cancer (34% [20 of 59]) ( P = .013). Patients with level IV metastasis had significantly worse 5-year disease-free survival rates than patients with metastasis to other neck levels (54% versus 71%; P = .04).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Magnetic resonance imaging of retropharyngeal lymph node metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Patterns of spread;,citation_abstract=Purpose: To investigate the incidence, distribution, and spread pattern of retropharyngeal lymph node (RLN) involvement in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods and Materials: The MR images of 275 patients with newly diagnosed NPC were reviewed retrospectively. Nodes were classified as metastatic based on size criteria, the presence of nodal necrosis, and extracapsular spread. Results: Retropharyngeal lymph node involvement was detected in 175 (63.6%) patients. Metastatic RLNs were seen at the following levels: occipital bone, 24 (9.6%) nodes; C1, 157 (62.5%) nodes; C1/2, 40 (15.9%) nodes; C2, 27 (10.8%) nodes; C2/3, 1 (0.4%) node; and C3, 2 (0.8%) nodes. The incidence of RLN involvement was equal to the incidence of cervical lymph node involvement (81.4% vs. 81.4%) in 215 patients with nodal metastases. A significantly higher incidence of metastatic RLNs was observed in the presence of oropharynx, prestyloid parapharyngeal space, post-styloid parapharyngeal space, longus colli muscle, medial pterygoid muscle, levator muscle of velum palatini, tensor muscle of velum palatini, Level II node, Level III node, and Level V node involvement. A significantly lower incidence of metastatic RLNs was found in T1, N0, and Stage I disease. Conversely, no significant difference in the incidence of metastatic RLNs was observed between T1, 2, and, 3; N2 and N3; or Stage II, III, and IV disease. Conclusions: There is an orderly decrease in the incidence of metastatic lateral RLNs from the C1 to C3 level. Metastatic RLNs associate well with involvement of certain structures in early stage primary tumors and lymph node metastases of the upper jugular chain (Level II, Level III nodes) and the posterior triangle (Level V nodes). Both RLNs and cervical Level II nodes appear to be the first-echelon nodes in NPC. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.;,citation_author=Li-Zhi Liu;,citation_author=Guo-Yi Zhang;,citation_author=Chuang-Miao Xie;,citation_author=Xue-Wen Liu;,citation_author=Chun-Yan Cui;,citation_author=Li Li;,citation_publication_date=2006-11;,citation_cover_date=2006-11;,citation_year=2006;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.05.054;,citation_issn=03603016;,citation_volume=66;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=International Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Adaptive fractionation therapy: I. Basic concept and strategy;,citation_abstract=Radiotherapy is fractionized to increase the therapeutic ratio. Fractionation in conventional treatment is determined as part of the prescription, and a fixed fraction size is used for the whole course of treatment. Due to patients’ day-to-day variations on the relative distance between the tumor and the organs at risk (OAR), a better therapeutic ratio may be attained by using an adaptive fraction size. Intuitively, we want to use a larger fraction size when OAR and the tumor are far apart and a smaller fraction size when OAR and the tumor are close to each other. The concept and strategies of adaptive fractionation therapy (AFT) are introduced in this paper. AFT is an on-line adaptive technique that utilizes the variations of internal structures to get optimal OAR sparing. Changes of internal structures are classified as different configurations according to their feasibility to the radiation delivery. A priori knowledge is used to describe the probability distribution of these configurations. On-line processes include identifying the configuration via daily image guidance and optimizing the current fraction size. The optimization is modeled as a dynamic linear programming problem so that at the end of the treatment course, the tumor receives the same planned dose while OAR receives less dose than the regular fractionation delivery. Extensive simulations, which include thousands of treatment courses with each course consisting of 40 fractions, are used to test the efficiency and robustness of the presented technique. The gains of OAR sparing depend on the variations on configurations and the bounds of the fraction size. The larger the variations and the looser the bounds are, the larger the gains will be. Compared to the conventional fractionation technique with 2 Gy/fraction in 40 fractions, for a 20% variation on tumor–OAR configurations and [1 Gy, 3 Gy] fraction size bounds, the cumulative OAR dose with adaptive fractionation is 3–8 Gy, or 7–20% less than that of the regular fractionation, while maintaining the same cumulative tumor dose as prescribed.;,citation_author=Weiguo Lu;,citation_author=Mingli Chen;,citation_author=Quan Chen;,citation_author=Kenneth Ruchala;,citation_author=Gustavo Olivera;,citation_publication_date=2008-10;,citation_cover_date=2008-10;,citation_year=2008;,citation_issue=19;,citation_doi=10.1088/0031-9155/53/19/015;,citation_issn=0031-9155, 1361-6560;,citation_volume=53;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Physics in Medicine and Biology;,citation_publisher=IOP Publishing;">

In this study, we investigate how the risk of metastases in each LNL depends on the involvement of upstream LNLs, T-category, HPV status and other risk factors. Materials/Methods We retrospectively analyzed patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) treated at a single institution, resulting in a dataset of 287 patients. For all patients, involvement of LNLs I-VII was recorded individually based on available diagnostic modalities (PET, MRI, CT, FNA) together with clinicopathological factors. To analyze the dataset, a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) was developed, which allows querying the number of patients with a certain combination of co-involved LNLs and tumor characteristics. Results The full dataset and GUI is part of the publication. Selected findings are: Ipsilateral level IV was involved in 27% of patients with level II and III involvement, but only in 2% of patients with level II but not III involvement. Prevalence of involvement of ipsilateral levels II, III, IV, V was 79%, 34%, 7%, 3% for early T-category patients (T1/T2) and 85%, 50%, 17%, 9% for late T-category (T3/T4), quantifying increasing involvement with T-category. Contralateral levels II, III, IV were involved in 41%, 19%, 4% and 12%, 3%, 2% for tumors with and without midline extension, respectively. T-stage dependence of LNL involvement was more pronounced in HPV negative than positive tumors, but overall involvement was similar. Ipsilateral level VII was involved in 14% and 6% of patients with primary tumors in the tonsil and the base of tongue, respectively.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A dynamic model for lymphatic progression of cancer through the head &amp;amp;amp; neck;,citation_abstract=Purpose/Objective: Currently, elective CTV definition in head &amp;amp; neck cancer is mostly based on the empiric prevalence of lymph node involvement for a given primary tumor location. However, an individual patient’s risk of harboring microscopic metastases in each lymph node level (LNL) varies depending on their T-stage and findings of macroscopic metastases in LNLs through imaging. We propose a probabilistic model for lymphatic metastatic spread that can quantify this risk of microscopic involvement based on the individual patient’s state of cancer progression, which may allow for personalized CTV-N definition. Material/Methods: A patient’s state of disease is modelled via one hidden binary random variable for each LNL, which indicates if the LNL harbors tumor including occult metastases. This hidden state of a LNL is connected via sensitivity and specificity to an observed binary random variable that indicates if metastases are seen on imaging. Over one-time step, tumor cells may spread from the primary tumor to an LNL, or between LNLs, with some probability rate. Formally, this is described by a hidden Markov model (HMM). The directed arcs of the HMM’s graph reflect the direction of lymph flow and spread probability rates are learned from a dataset of patients in whom involvement of each LNL was reported (Figure 1). T-stage can be incorporated into the model by assuming that on average late T-stage tumors had more time to progress than early T-stage tumors. We demonstrate the HMM model for ipsilateral spread of oropharyngeal head &amp; neck squamous cell carcinoma, trained via MCMC sampling using a dataset reconstructed from [2], and under the assumption that the portion of N0 patients is 30% for early T-stage patients and 20% for late T-stage. Results: Figure 2 shows the risk of occult metastases in LNL III and IV depending on T-stage and whether the upstream LNLs II and III harbor macroscopic metastases. For early T-stage, the expected risk for microscopic involvement of LNL III rises from 4.8  1.0 % for N0 patients to 10.2  1.8 % when macroscopic metastases in LNL II are observed. For late T-stage and macroscopic metastases in LNL II, the risk increases further to 13.7 2.8 % (figure 2a). Analogous findings are observed for level IV (figure 2b). Conclusions: HMMs provide a statistical framework to model the spread of lymphatic metastases. It allows us to estimate the risk of microscopic involvement of LNLs depending on T-stage and location of macroscopic metastases. But larger datasets of detailed involvement patterns, rather than reports of only prevalence, are needed before the model may inform guidelines for CTV-N definition.;,citation_author=Roman Ludwig;,citation_author=Bertrand Pouymayou;,citation_author=Panagiotis Balermpas;,citation_author=Jan Unkelbach;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_conference_title=ESTRO;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A hidden Markov model for lymphatic tumor progression in the head and neck;,citation_abstract=Abstract Currently, elective clinical target volume (CTV-N) definition for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is mostly based on the prevalence of nodal involvement for a given tumor location. In this work, we propose a probabilistic model for lymphatic metastatic spread that can quantify the risk of microscopic involvement in lymph node levels (LNL) given the location of macroscopic metastases and T-category. This may allow for further personalized CTV-N definition based on an individual patient’s state of disease. We model the patient’s state of metastatic lymphatic progression as a collection of hidden binary random variables that indicate the involvement of LNLs. In addition, each LNL is associated with observed binary random variables that indicate whether macroscopic metastases are detected. A hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to compute the probabilities of transitions between states over time. The underlying graph of the HMM represents the anatomy of the lymphatic drainage system. Learning of the transition probabilities is done via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and is based on a dataset of HNSCC patients in whom involvement of individual LNLs was reported. The model is demonstrated for ipsilateral metastatic spread in oropharyngeal HNSCC patients. We demonstrate the model’s capability to quantify the risk of microscopic involvement in levels III and IV, depending on whether macroscopic metastases are observed in the upstream levels II and III, and depending on T-category. In conclusion, the statistical model of lymphatic progression may inform future, more personalized, guidelines on which LNL to include in the elective CTV.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modelling Lymphatic Metastatic Progression in Head and Neck Cancer;,citation_abstract=Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are often treated using radiotherapy. Because this type of cancer frequently spreads to regional lymph nodes, parts of the lymphatic system are irradiated alongside the primary tumor. Macroscopic nodal metastasis, visible on imaging modalities such as computed tomography, is always included in the target volume of radiotherapy. Additionally, clinicians electively irradiate lymph node levels (LNLs) when their estimated risk to harbor microscopic disease exceeds a given threshold. Currently, this risk estimate is based on the overall prevalence of metastatic involvement in a given LNL as reported in the literature. However, few published studies on lymphatic metastatic progression patterns investigate how the probability of involvement of LNLs depends on the involvement of other levels and clinicopathological factors such as T-category, which is of crucial importance to create more personalized elective target volumes. This work makes three related contributions to address this problem: 1) We extracted a dataset of patients diagnosed with oropharyngeal SCC at the University Hospital Zurich (USZ). This dataset details the observed involvement per LNL and diagnostic modality together with tumor characteristics including subsite, T-category, lateralization and HPV status. It is thereby the most detailed dataset on patterns of lymphatic progression to date. 2) In addition to sharing the full dataset freely with the research community, we developed an intuitive web page named LyProX. The interface on this web page allows researchers to visually and interactively explore the data extracted at the USZ, as well as another dataset that was kindly provided to us by Vincent Grégoire in response to our efforts. 3) Lastly, we have developed a hidden Markov model (HMM) that predicts the risk of microscopic disease, given an individual patient’s clinical diagnosis. It builds on a previous probabilistic model using Bayesian networks (BNs) for the involvement of ipsilateral LNLs I, II, III, and IV, but extends it to naturally include T-category as diagnostic variable. Using Bayesian model comparison, the HMM framework is extended to include the LNLs I, II, III, IV, V, and VII in both the ipsi- and the contralateral side of the neck, accounting for the primary tumor’s extension over the mid-sagittal plane as risk factor for contralateral nodal involvement. Ultimately, we train the HMM with the available data and demonstrate how the resulting predictions may be used to quantitatively predict the personalized risk of occult disease. We find that our model supports a reduction of electively irradiated nodal volumes, especially in the contralateral neck. As such, our model may support the design of future clinical trials on volume-deescalated radiotherapy of HNSCC.;,citation_author=Roman Ludwig;,citation_publication_date=2023;,citation_cover_date=2023;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.5167/uzh-231470;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_dissertation_institution=University of Zurich;">

As such, the data may contribute to further personalize the elective treatment of the neck for HNSCC patients, i.e. definition of the elective clinical target volume (CTV-N) in radiotherapy (RT) and the extent of neck dissection (ND) in surgery. There exists only one similar publicly available dataset that reports clinical involvement per LNL in 287 oropharyngeal SCC patients [2]. The data presented in this article substantially extends the available data, it additionally includes pathologically assessed involvement per LNL, and it provides data for multiple subsites in the head and neck region.;,citation_author=Roman Ludwig;,citation_author=Adrian Schubert;,citation_author=Dorothea Barbatei;,citation_author=Laurence Bauwens;,citation_author=Sandrine Werlen;,citation_author=Olgun Elicin;,citation_author=Matthias Dettmer;,citation_author=Philippe Zrounba;,citation_author=Panagiotis Balermpas;,citation_author=Bertrand Pouymayou;,citation_author=Vincent Grégoire;,citation_author=Roland Giger;,citation_author=Jan Unkelbach;,citation_publication_date=2024-02;,citation_cover_date=2024-02;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.dib.2023.110020;,citation_issn=23523409;,citation_volume=52;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Data in Brief;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Personalized elective clinical target volume definition in head &amp;amp;amp; neck cancer;,citation_abstract=Purpose/Objective: Head &amp;amp; neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) spread lymphatically through the neck and form metastases in regional lymph nodes. Modern imaging techniques such as FDG-PET/CT can visualize sufficiently large metastases but fail to detect small occult metastases. Therefore, large parts of the neck are electively irradiated as part of the nodal clinical target volume (CTV-N). Here, we report on activities within a newly formed ESTRO working group that aims at developing computational methods to support CTV definition. The goal of this specific project is to improve quantification of the risk of occult disease in lymph node levels (LNL), considering the individual patient’s state of tumor progression. Materials/Methods: Quantification of the risk of occult metastases relies on three main components. (1) detailed datasets of lymphatic progression patterns that report, on a patient-by-patient basis, the location of lymph node metastases together with primary tumor characteristics such as location, T-category, midsagittal plane extension, and HPV status; (2) sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic modalities to detect lymph node metastases, obtained from comparing pathological and clinical lymph node involvement; and (3) a statistical model that quantitatively describes lymphatic metastatic progression and the diagnostic process. Results: To address (1), we developed a web-based platform to host, visualize, and share datasets of lymphatic progression patterns, currently containing two datasets of 287 and 263 oropharyngeal HNSCC patients from independent institutions. Figure 1 illustrates the use of the platform. To address (3), we develop a probabilistic model of metastatic progression based on Hidden Markov Models (Figure 2, upper panel). In this model, each LNL is represented by a hidden binary random variable that indicates if a LNL truly harbors tumor including occult metastases. Each LNL is further associated with a binary observed state, which indicates if the LNL harbors visible macroscopic metastases. Hidden microscopic state and observed macroscopic state are linked via (2), sensitivity and specificity. The parameters of the model are the probabilities for the primary tumor to spread to a LNL and the probabilities to spread from upstream to downstream LNL along the lymphatic drainage, which are learned from (1), datasets of lymph node level involvement. Estimating the risk of occult metastases for a newly diagnosed patient corresponds to calculating marginals of the joint probability distribution of LNL involvement conditioned on the patient’s diagnose (Figure 2, bottom panel). Conclusions: Quantification of the probability of occult metastases in LNLs considering the individual patient’s primary tumor characteristics and the visible state of nodal progression may allow for personalized volume de-escalation strategies to reduce treatment toxicity. To achieve this, larger multi-institutional training datasets are being collected.;,citation_author=Roman Ludwig;,citation_author=Bertrand Pouymayou;,citation_author=Jean-Marc Hoffmann;,citation_author=Matthias Guckenberger;,citation_author=Laurence Bauwens;,citation_author=Vincent Grégoire;,citation_author=Panagiotis Balermpas;,citation_author=Jan Unkelbach;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_conference_title=ICHNO/ECHNO;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting bilateral involvement in head &amp;amp;amp; neck cancer using an interpretable probabilistic model;,citation_abstract=Purpose/Objective: In current clinical practice, the elective clinical target volume (CTV-N) for oropharyngeal head &amp;amp; neck squamous cell carcinoma (OHNSCC) is defined using prevalence-based guidelines [1], which recommend extensive bilateral neck irradiation for most patients. However, the actual patient-specific risk of harboring microscopic metastases in the contralateral neck remains insufficiently quantified. We propose a probabilistic and interpretable model for predicting the personalized risk of involvement in lymph node levels (LNLs) of both sides of the neck depending on T-stage, location of macroscopic metastases, and the primary tumor’s lateralization. This may identify additional patients in whom contralateral neck irradiation can be avoided or reduced, possibly reducing toxicity. Materials/Methods: We extracted the lymphatic patterns of progression for 287 OHNSCC patients treated at our institution. The data can be visualized at www.lyprox.org. This was used to train the hidden Markov model (HMM) for predicting nodal involvement we developed and published recently [2]. For this work, the model in [2] was extended to contralateral spread while treating mid-sagittal plane extension of the primary tumor as risk factor. It models the LNLs as binary random variables connected in a directed graph (Figure 1). The edges of the graph represent the lymphatic drainage pathways, which are associated with probabilities of metastatic spread per abstract time step. These are the parameters of the HMM that are learned from the dataset of 287 patients. Results: Figure 2a) shows the predicted risk of microscopic metastases in contralateral LNL II depending on T-category, the extent of CT-observed macroscopic metastases, and midline extension as a risk factor. This risk is low (0.5  0.3 %) for patients with early T-category (T1 &amp; T2) tumors not extending over the midline with no clinically involved LNLs. However, it is significantly higher when the tumor is not lateralized, and we observe ipsilateral LNL II to be metastatic (7.2  1.9 %). It further increases for late T-category (8.3  2 %) and once more when the ipsilateral LNLs II, III and IV are clinically involved (10.3  2.6 %). Figure 2b) shows the risk predicted for involvement in contralateral LNL III depending on the upstream level II. Conclusion: An HMM as probabilistic framework proves to be both flexible to expand and suitable for predicting the risk of microscopic involvement in a personalized manner. We can specify a patient by T-category, observed macroscopic involvement and the primary tumor’s midline extension to compute their risk for harboring microscopic metastases in any LNL recorded in the training cohort. Multi-institutional detailed datasets are however needed to validate the model’s accuracy.;,citation_author=Roman Ludwig;,citation_author=Bertrand Pouymayou;,citation_author=Jean-Marc Hoffmann;,citation_author=Panagiotis Balermpas;,citation_author=Jan Unkelbach;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_conference_title=ESTRO;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mapping stellar surfaces III: An Efficient, Scalable, and Open-Source Doppler Imaging Model;,citation_abstract=The study of stellar surfaces can reveal information about the chemical composition, interior structure, and magnetic properties of stars. It is also critical to the detection and characterization of extrasolar planets, in particular those targeted in extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) searches, which must contend with stellar variability that is often orders of magnitude stronger than the planetary signal. One of the most successful methods to map the surfaces of stars is Doppler imaging, in which the presence of inhomogeneities is inferred from subtle line shape changes in high resolution stellar spectra. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient, and closed-form solution to the problem of Doppler imaging of stellar surfaces. Our model explicitly allows for incomplete knowledge of the local (rest frame) stellar spectrum, allowing one to learn differences from spectral templates while simultaneously mapping the stellar surface. It therefore works on blended lines, regions of the spectrum where line formation mechanisms are not well understood, or stars whose spots have intrinsically different spectra from the rest of the photosphere. We implement the model within the open source starry framework, making it fast, differentiable, and easy to use in both optimization and posterior inference settings. As a proof-of-concept, we use our model to infer the surface map of the brown dwarf WISE 1049-5319B, finding close agreement with the solution of Crossfield et al. (2014). We also discuss Doppler imaging in the context of EPRV studies and describe an interpretable spectral-temporal Gaussian process for stellar spectral variability that we expect will be important for EPRV exoplanet searches.;,citation_author=Rodrigo Luger;,citation_author=Megan Bedell;,citation_author=Daniel Foreman-Mackey;,citation_author=Ian J.

The risk factors for development of cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx include tobacco exposure and alcohol dependence, and infection with oncogenic viruses is associated with cancers developing in the nasopharynx, palatine, and lingual tonsils of the oropharynx. The incidence of human papillomavirus–associated oropharyngeal cancer is increasing in developed countries, and by 2020, the annual incidence could surpass that of cervical cancer. The treatment for early-stage squamous cell cancers of the head and neck is generally single modality, either surgery or radiotherapy. The treatment for locally advanced head and neck cancers is multimodal, with either surgery followed by adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation as indicated by pathologic features or definitive chemoradiation. For recurrent disease that is not amenable to a salvage local or regional approach and for metastatic disease, chemotherapy with or without a biological agent is indicated. To date, molecular testing has not influenced treatment selection in head and neck cancer.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Extracapsular spread in head and neck carcinoma: Impact of site and human papillomavirus status;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND Extracapsular spread (ECS) in cervical lymph node metastases from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is regarded as an adverse prognostic factor and is often used to select patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapy. The prognostic value of ECS was evaluated for patients with oropharyngeal SCC (OPC; with known p16/human papillomavirus [HPV] status) and for patients with SCC of the oral cavity (OCC). METHODS Disease-specific survival (DSS) was assessed among SCC patients with cervical lymph node metastases (n = 347, including 133 patients with OPC and 214 patients with OCC). All patients were treated surgically between 1983 and 2009. ECS status was determined by pathologists at the time of initial pathologic evaluation and confirmed for this study. HPV status of patients with OPC was determined via immunohistochemistry for p16 and in situ hybridization. RESULTS Among OCC patients, ECS was a significant, independent factor influencing DSS. For OCC patients with ECS, 3-year DSS was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36%-56%); for those without ECS, 3-year DSS was 71% (95% CI, 62%-81%; P  = .0018). The effect of ECS was independent of the number of positive lymph nodes as well as other clinical, pathologic, and treatment variables. Of the 133 OPC patients, 76 (57%) were p16-positive and 57 (43%) were p16-negative. ECS status did not correlate with DSS among p16-positive or p16-negative OPC patients. CONCLUSION ECS was not associated with worse DSS in p16-positive or p16-negative OPC patients. Adverse prognostic value of ECS in OCC patients was confirmed. Cancer 2013;119:3302–8 . © 2013 American Cancer Society . , This study demonstrates that extracapsular spread is not associated with worse survival in p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients and may not be associated with worse survival in p16-negative oropharyngeal cancer patients.

Indeed, standardized diagnostic and grading criteria of ECS are still lacking. The imaging modality of choice for its diagnosis is a matter of debate. Current research looking at the identification of specific biomarkers is ongoing. Recent findings demonstrate a direct correlation between the level of extension of ECS and a poor prognosis.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Tutorial on Modern Bayesian Methods in Clinical Trials;,citation_abstract=Clinical trials continue to be the gold standard for evaluating new medical technologies. New advancements in modern computation power have led to increasing interest in Bayesian methods. Despite the multiple benefits of Bayesian approaches, application to clinical trials has been limited. Based on insights from the survey of clinical researchers in drug development conducted by the Drug Information Association Bayesian Scientific Working Group (DIA BSWG), insufficient knowledge of Bayesian approaches was ranked as the most important perceived barrier to implementing Bayesian methods. Results of the same survey indicate that clinical researchers may find the interpretation of results from a Bayesian analysis to be more useful than conventional interpretations. In this article, we illustrate key concepts tied to Bayesian methods, starting with familiar concepts widely used in clinical practice before advancing in complexity, and use practical illustrations from clinical development.;,citation_author=Natalia Muehlemann;,citation_author=Tianjian Zhou;,citation_author=Rajat Mukherjee;,citation_author=Munshi Imran Hossain;,citation_author=Satrajit Roychoudhury;,citation_author=Estelle Russek-Cohen;,citation_publication_date=2023-05;,citation_cover_date=2023-05;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1007/s43441-023-00515-3;,citation_issn=2168-4790, 2168-4804;,citation_volume=57;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Therapeutic Innovation &amp;amp;amp; Regulatory Science;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cervical nodal metastases in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: What to expect;,citation_abstract=Abstract The treatment and management of malignancies of the head and neck is directly altered by the presence of metastatic cervical adenopathy. The treatment of nodal metastases in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCCA) is determined by the lymphatic drainage of the upper aerodigestive tract. The lymphatic drainage is site-specific and occurs in a predictable manner. The purpose of this text is to provide an overview of the normal routes of lymphatic drainage in the head and neck and correlate this with the current nodal classification system. The specific aims of this manuscript are to 1) illustrate the expected lymphatic drainage patterns of HNSCCA arising in the different subsites (nasopharynx, oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx, and hypopharynx) and 2) review the expected frequency of metastases within nodal groups for HNSCCA that arise in these locations. An understanding of the topographical distribution and incidence of cervical lymph node metastases plays an integral role in the physical examination and radiological evaluation of patients with HNSCCA. For the neuroradiologist, this information may increases the ability to identify those nodal groups at risk for metastatic involvement. © 2001 John Wiley &amp;amp;amp; Sons, Inc.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Distributed Markov chain Monte Carlo;,citation_abstract=We consider the design of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for large-scale, distributed, heterogeneous compute facilities, with a focus on synthesising sample sets across multiple runs performed in parallel. While theory suggests that many independent Markov chains may be run and their samples pooled, the well-known practical problem of quasi-ergodicity, or poor mixing, frustrates this otherwise simple approach. Furthermore, without some mechanism for hastening the convergence of individual chains, overall speedup from parallelism is limited by the portion of each chain to be discarded as burn-in. Existing multiple-chain methods, such as parallel tempering and population MCMC, use a synchronous exchange of samples to expedite convergence. This work instead proposes mixing in an additional independent proposal, representing some hitherto best estimate or summary of the posterior, and cooperatively adapting this across chains. Such adaptation can be asynchronous, increases the ensemble’s robustness to quasi-ergodic behaviour in constituent chains, and may improve overall tolerance to fault.;,citation_author=Lawrence Murray;,citation_language=en-US;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prostate-Only Versus Whole-Pelvic Radiation Therapy in High-Risk and Very High-Risk Prostate Cancer (POP-RT): Outcomes From Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial;,citation_abstract=PURPOSE We report the clinical outcomes of a randomized trial comparing prophylactic whole-pelvic nodal radiotherapy to prostate-only radiotherapy (PORT) in high-risk prostate cancer. METHODS This phase III, single center, randomized controlled trial enrolled eligible patients undergoing radical radiotherapy for node-negative prostate adenocarcinoma, with estimated nodal risk $\geq$ 20%. Randomization was 1:1 to PORT (68 Gy/25# to prostate) or whole-pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT, 68 Gy/25# to prostate, 50 Gy/25# to pelvic nodes, including common iliac) using computerized stratified block randomization, stratified by Gleason score, type of androgen deprivation, prostate-specific antigen at diagnosis, and prior transurethral resection of the prostate. All patients received image-guided, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and minimum 2 years of androgen deprivation therapy. The primary end point was 5-year biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), and secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS From November 2011 to August 2017, a total of 224 patients were randomly assigned (PORT = 114, WPRT = 110). At a median follow-up of 68 months, 36 biochemical failures (PORT = 25, WPRT = 7) and 24 deaths (PORT = 13, WPRT = 11) were recorded. Five-year BFFS was 95.0% (95% CI, 88.4 to 97.9) with WPRT versus 81.2% (95% CI, 71.6 to 87.8) with PORT, with an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.23 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.52; P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .0001). WPRT also showed higher 5-year DFS (89.5% v 77.2%; HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.73; P = .002), but 5-year OS did not appear to differ (92.5% v 90.8%; HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.41 to 2.05; P = .83). Distant metastasis-free survival was also higher with WPRT (95.9% v 89.2%; HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.82; P = .01). Benefit in BFFS and DFS was maintained across prognostic subgroups. CONCLUSION Prophylactic pelvic irradiation for high-risk, locally advanced prostate cancer improved BFFS and DFS as compared with PORT, but OS did not appear to differ.;,citation_author=Vedang Murthy;,citation_author=Priyamvada Maitre;,citation_author=Sadhana Kannan;,citation_author=Gitanjali Panigrahi;,citation_author=Rahul Krishnatry;,citation_author=Ganesh Bakshi;,citation_author=Gagan Prakash;,citation_author=Mahendra Pal;,citation_author=Santosh Menon;,citation_author=Reena Phurailatpam;,citation_author=Smruti Mokal;,citation_author=Dipika Chaurasiya;,citation_author=Palak Popat;,citation_author=Nilesh Sable;,citation_author=Archi Agarwal;,citation_author=Venkatesh Rangarajan;,citation_author=Amit Joshi;,citation_author=Vanita Noronha;,citation_author=Kumar Prabhash;,citation_author=Umesh Mahantshetty;,citation_publication_date=2021-04;,citation_cover_date=2021-04;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.1200/JCO.20.03282;,citation_issn=0732-183X, 1527-7755;,citation_volume=39;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Clinical Oncology;,citation_publisher=Wolters Kluwer;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Recent Advances and Future Directions in Clinical Management of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;,citation_abstract=Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most common cancer arising in the head and neck region. The most common risk factors are smoking, excessive drinking, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. While the overall incidence of smoking is decreasing, the incidence of HPV-related HNSCC is increasing in the United States and Western Europe, which led to a shift in understanding of the pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis of this disease. The outcomes for non-metastatic HNSCC remains very encouraging and continues to improve. Advances in radiation technology and techniques, better organ preserving surgical options, and multidisciplinary treatment modalities have improved cure rates for locally advanced HNSCC patients. The treatment of metastatic disease, however, remains an area of need. The advancement of immune checkpoint inhibitors has provided significantly better outcomes, but only a small proportion of patients obtain benefits. Most recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC patients continue to have poor survival. This has led to the vigorous investigation of new biomarkers and biomarker-based therapies. Novel therapeutic options including adaptive cellular therapy and therapeutic vaccines are also on the horizon. In this review, we highlight the latest advances in the field of HNSCC and the future direction of research.;,citation_author=Jameel Muzaffar;,citation_author=Shahla Bari;,citation_author=Kedar Kirtane;,citation_author=Christine H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=RUN DMC: AN EFFICIENT, PARALLEL CODE FOR ANALYZING RADIAL VELOCITY OBSERVATIONS USING &amp;amp;amp;lt;i&amp;gt;N&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; -BODY INTEGRATIONS AND DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO;,citation_abstract=In the 20+ years of Doppler observations of stars, scientists have uncovered a diverse population of extrasolar multi-planet systems. A common technique for characterizing the orbital elements of these planets is the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), using a Keplerian model with random walk proposals and paired with the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. For approximately a couple of dozen planetary systems with Doppler observations, there are strong planet–planet interactions due to the system being in or near a mean-motion resonance (MMR). An N-body model is often required to accurately describe these systems. Further computational difficulties arise from exploring a high-dimensional parameter space ($\sim$7  number of planets) that can have complex parameter correlations, particularly for systems near a MMR. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a differential evolution MCMC (DEMCMC) algorithm applied to radial velocity data while incorporating self-consistent N-body integrations. Our Radial velocity Using N-body DEMCMC (RUN DMC) algorithm improves upon the random walk proposal distribution of the traditional MCMC by using an ensemble of Markov chains to adaptively improve the proposal distribution. RUN DMC can sample more efficiently from high-dimensional parameter spaces that have strong correlations between model parameters. We describe the methodology behind the algorithm, along with results of tests for accuracy and performance. We find that most algorithm parameters have a modest effect on the rate of convergence. However, the size of the ensemble can have a strong effect on performance. We show that the optimal choice depends on the number of planets in a system, as well as the computer architecture used and the resulting extent of parallelization. While the exact choices of optimal algorithm parameters will inevitably vary due to the details of individual planetary systems (e.g., number of planets, number of observations, orbital periods, and signal-to-noise of each planet), we offer recommendations for choosing the DEMCMC algorithm’s algorithmic parameters that result in excellent performance for a wide variety of planetary systems.;,citation_author=Benjamin Nelson;,citation_author=Eric B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Tumor Control Probability (TCP) and Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) with Consideration of Cell Biological Effect;,citation_abstract=Abstract In radiotherapy, Tumor Control Probability (TCP) is a parameter used to calculate the percentage of tumor killing, while its effect on normal tissue damage describe by Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP). Both TCP and NTCP depend on fractionation and cell biological effects such as repopulation, repair, redistribution and re-oxygenation. It also depends on the statistical distribution model used. One model that can review the biological effects of cells is the Poisson model. In this research, we modified the Poisson model by considering the four biological effects mentioned above on TCP and only the effect of repair on NTCP. The objective of this research is to investigate the most dominant effect that influences TCP value and the effect of repair on NTCP. The results show that the effect of repair and repopulation cause tumor cells cannot be erased completely while the effects of resenitization (re-oxygenation and redistribution) can facilitate tumor cells to die. It can be seen that the most dominant biological effect is the repair effect on the tumor. This effect can be minimized by reducing the length of dose delivery time. Furthermore, the repair effect on normal tissue can reduce the value of NTCP about 9% compared with other models. By using the ISO-NTCP curve we also get the spinal cord repair time after 15 hours.;,citation_author=Rany Nuraini;,citation_author=Rena Widita;,citation_publication_date=2019-08;,citation_cover_date=2019-08;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1088/1742-6596/1245/1/012092;,citation_issn=1742-6588, 1742-6596;,citation_volume=1245;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Physics: Conference Series;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=DEBI-NN: Distance-encoding biomorphic-informational neural networks for minimizing the number of trainable parameters;,citation_abstract=Modern artificial intelligence (AI) approaches mainly rely on neural network (NN) or deep NN methodologies.

This property renders deep NNs challenging to apply in fields operating with small, albeit representative datasets such as healthcare. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture which trains spatial positions of neural soma and axon pairs, where weights are calculated by axon-soma distances of connected neurons. We refer to this method as distance-encoding biomorphic-informational (DEBI) neural network. This concept significantly minimizes the number of trainable parameters compared to conventional neural networks. We demonstrate that DEBI models can yield comparable predictive performance in tabular and imaging datasets, where they require a fraction of trainable parameters compared to conventional NNs, resulting in a highly scalable solution.;,citation_author=Laszlo Papp;,citation_author=David Haberl;,citation_author=Boglarka Ecsedi;,citation_author=Clemens P.

For 134 lesions, accuracy and confidence were compared among PET, MRI, and PET/MRI. For lesion base, PET/MRI had a sensitivity of 85.7%, a specificity of 89.1%, a PPV of 89.6%, a negative predictive value of 85.1%, and an accuracy of 87.3%. AUCs of PET/MRI per lesion (0.926) and per patient (0.934) for diagnosing malignancy were higher than PET (0.847 and 0.747, respectively) or MRI (0.836 and 0.798, respectively) alone (P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.05).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Adaptive Fractionation at the MR-Linac;,citation_abstract=Objective: Inter-fraction motion of tumors and OARs can be visualized using MR-guidance. Whereas standard treatments aim to deliver the same dose in each fraction, adaptive fractionation (AF) is an approach to exploit inter-fraction motion by increasing the dose on days when the distance of tumor and OAR is large and decreasing the dose on unfavorable days. We develop an algorithm for AF and evaluate the concept for patients with abdominal tumors previously treated on the MR-Linac in 5 fractions. Approach: Given daily adapted treatment plans, inter-fractional changes are quantified by sparing factors $\delta_t$. The key problem of AF is to decide on the dose to deliver in fraction $t$, given $\delta_t$ and the dose delivered in previous fractions, but with unknown future sparing factors. Optimal doses are computed with a dynamic programming algorithm that assumes a normal distribution over $\delta$ with mean and variance estimated from previously observed patient-specific $\delta_t$s. The computed doses maximize the expected tumor BED$_{10}$ while staying below a maximum BED$_3$ in the OAR. To evaluate the algorithm, 16 MR-Linac patients were retrospectively analyzed in whom tumor dose was compromised due to proximity of bowel, stomach, or duodenum. AF was compared to a reference treatment which delivers 6 Gy to the OAR in each fraction to reach exactly the 90 Gy BED$_3$ constraint. Main Results: In 14 out of the 16 patients, AF increased the tumor BED$_{10}$ compared to the reference treatment. However, in 11 of these 14 patients, the increase in BED$_{10}$ was below 1 Gy, while two patients had an increase of more than 10 Gy BED$_{10}$. One patient with an inferior plan had a decrease of 5.2 BED$_{10}$. All extreme results were associated with large sparing factor variation. Significance: On average, AF provided only a small increase in tumor BED. However, AF may yield substantial benefits for individual patients with large variations in the geometry.;,citation_author=Yoel Pérez Haas;,citation_author=Roman Ludwig;,citation_author=Riccardo Dal Bello;,citation_author=Stephanie Tanadini-Lang;,citation_author=Jan Unkelbach;,citation_publication_date=2022-04;,citation_cover_date=2022-04;,citation_year=2022;,citation_language=en-US;">

Materials and Methods: Given daily MR scans and adaptive treatment plans, inter-fractional changes in fraction t are quantified by sparing factors $\delta$t, which are defined as the ratio of dose delivered to the OAR (D1cc) and the tumor (D95%). The key problem of AF is to decide on the dose to deliver in fraction t, given today’s $\delta$ and the dose delivered in previous fractions, but with unknown future $\delta$s. This problem can be formulated as a Markov decision problem and solved with a dynamic programming algorithm. The algorithm assumes a normal distribution over $\delta$ with mean and variance estimated from previously observed patient specific $\delta$s and a population based prior for the variance. Based on the distribution, the algorithm computes optimal doses that maximize the expected tumor BED10 while staying below the maximum BED3 of 90 Gy in the OAR (30 Gy in 5 fractions). To evaluate the algorithm, 10 MR-Linac patients were exported in whom tumor dose was compromised due to proximity of bowel, stomach, duodenum or heart. Moreover, 1000 synthetic patients with similar $\delta$ distribution have been sampled. AF was compared to a standard plan which delivers 6 Gy to the OAR in each fraction to reach exactly the 90 Gy BED3 constraint. Results: In 7 of the 10 patients, AF was equal or increased the tumor BED10, on average by 0.72 Gy (1.2%). Figure 1 shows the ’s and the respective doses based on AF for all patients. The biggest increase of 13.1 Gy (18.4%) was achieved for patient 2 with $\delta$=[0.88,0.8,0.58,0.86,0.77] where AF delivered tumor doses of [4.4,8.7,17,0.9,2.1] and thereby exploited the low $\delta$ in fraction 3. Figure 2a) illustrates the optimal policy for fraction 3, i.e. optimal dose to deliver as a function of $\delta$. For the 1000 generated patients, 84.1% of plans were equal or superior to the standard plan with a mean improvement of 1.01 Gy (1.5%) BED10. A distribution of the differences is shown in Figure 2b). With the most extreme plans having a benefit of up to 12 Gy BED10. Conclusion: On average, AF provided only a small increase in tumor BED. However, AF may yield substantial benefits for individual patients with large variations in the geometry.;,citation_author=Yoel Pérez Haas;,citation_author=Roman Ludwig;,citation_author=Riccardo Dal Bello;,citation_author=Lan Wenhong;,citation_author=Stephanie Tanadini-Lang;,citation_author=Jan Unkelbach;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_conference_title=ESTRO;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rationale for elective neck dissection;,citation_abstract=The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of cervical lymph nodes and the pathologically confirmed status of cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and to provide imaging evaluation parameters for the clinical diagnosis of cervical lymph node status in OSCC. In a retrospective analysis, 79 patients who were first pathologically diagnosed with OSCC were included. The MRI-derived imaging parameters of the cervical lymph nodes were evaluated and the pathological status of lymph nodes in neck dissection specimens was reviewed. The relationship between the imaging parameters and cervical LNM was analyzed. The MRI-derived imaging parameters of 4419 lymph nodes were evaluated, and the pathological status of 2463 lymph nodes was reviewed. The MRI-derived shortest axial diameter (SAD) and unclear boundary of the cervical lymph node were significantly related to LNM. The cutoff value of SAD that enabled identification of LNM was 3.6 mm, and it was 4.2 and 4.1 mm for the prediction of overall survival and disease-specific survival, respectively. The MRI-derived parameters SAD and unclear boundary of the cervical lymph node correlated with LNM in OSCC. MRI-derived SAD larger than 3 mm warrants simultaneous neck dissection at initial surgery. To explore the effects of elective neck irradiation (ENI) in clinically node-negative (cN0) sinonasal adenoid cystic carcinoma (SNACC). Between January 2000 and December 2016, 60 patients with cN0 sinonasal adenoid cystic carcinoma receiving surgery combined with radiotherapy were analyzed retrospectively, there were 39 received ENI (ENI group) and 21 with no ENI (non-ENI group). Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance clinical factors and match patients. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model were used to evaluate the impact of ENI on regional relapse risk and survival outcomes. The median follow-up time for our cohort was 82.0 months (12.4–190.7 months). Four patients (6.7%) developed neck nodal relapses, with a median time to progression of 38.8 months. Among them, two patients in ENI group but failed out-field. After PSM, 21 patients were matched in each group. The 7-year regional relapse-free survival (RRFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) between ENI group and non-ENI group were 85.4% vs 73.3% (p = 0.845), 65.2% vs 65.6% (p = 0.548), 68.3% vs 66.2% (p = 0.425), and 87.3% vs 84.0% (p = 0.953). Multivariate Cox analysis showed ENI was not an independent prognostic factor associated with RRFS, DMFS, PFS and OS. Our findings firstly demonstrated the omission of elective neck irradiation in the management of cN0 sinonasal adenoid cystic carcinoma might be safe without compromising disease control and should be further investigated. We evaluated the relationships between depth of invasion (DOI) of tongue cancer, as measured with preoperative T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and postoperative histopathologic (Path) specimens, with cervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM) and tumor stage. We also calculated the correlation of MRI and Path DOI measurements. This retrospective study included 101 patients who had squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and were treated surgically. Two observers measured DOI on all 3 modalities. DOI thresholds for predicting CLNM with high diagnostic efficacy were 6.99 mm and 8.32 mm for MRI and 5 mm for Path. DOI values from all modalities were significantly different for tumors with and without CLNM (P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .01) and for the 4 TNM stages (P $\leq$ .05), with increasing values corresponding to advancement in tumor stage. Addition of DOI changed the T level of many tumors based on the new TNM (tumor–node–metastasis) classification. The correlation coefficient between DOI calculated on each MRI sequence and Path was 0.90. MRI-derived DOI accurately reflected the subsequent metastatic status and degree of progression of tumor stages, with a strong positive correlation to Path values, and may be considered a predictor of tumor stage and CLNM. Elective neck dissection (END) versus observation remains controversial for cT1N0M0 oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The aim of this study was to determine whether neck dissection is indicated for cT1N0M0 OSCC versus observation when considering oral cavity subsites and depth of invasion (DOI) as predictors. A multicenter, ambispective cohort study of patients with cT1N0M0 OSCC treated at the University of Michigan and Beijing Stomatological Hospital from August 1998 to July 2017 with a follow-up end date of July 2019 was performed. Patients were excluded if follow-up was less than 2 years and no neck disease had occurred or if the final pathologic analysis resulted in upstaging to T2 using American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria, eighth edition. A total of 283 patients met the criteria. The main outcome parameter was the 2-year neck metastatic rate. The total 2-year lymph node metastatic rate was 11.3%. Overall neck metastatic rates escalated consistently according to DOI: less than 2 mm, 2.1%; 2 to 3 mm, 9.4%; 3 to 4 mm, 15.2%; and 4 to 5 mm, 24.6%. On univariate Cox regression analysis, DOI greater than 3 mm, tumor grade, and perineural invasion were statistically significant indicators of 2-year neck metastasis. On multivariate analysis, only DOI and tumor grade remained. On multivariate analysis of 2-year survival, no factors were independent predictors. Our proposed treatment strategy for END based both on statistically significant results for DOI and on review of the raw data using a 20% cutoff analysis showed cutoffs of 2 mm for the tongue (18.2%), 3 mm for the floor of the mouth (40.0%) and upper gingiva (20%), and 4 mm for the lower gingiva (33.3%) and no cutoff for the hard palate (0.0%). The watch-and-wait approach remains a reasonable approach in selected patients with cT1N0M0 OSCC. Decision making for END in T1N0M0 patients should minimally consider tumor grade, DOI, and oral cavity subsite. To determine the effects of nodal yield on survival in early stage oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) in the context of primary tumor depth of invasion (DOI). Patients with early-stage clinically node-negative OCSCC who underwent upfront surgery at the primary site were identified using the National Cancer Database between 2004 and 2015. There were 3384 patients with $&amp;lt;$4 mm DOI and 1387 patients with $\geq$4 mm DOI identified. Management of the neck included observation (40%), END with $<$18 nodes harvested  postoperative radiation (ND $<$ 18, 16%), and END with $\geq$18 nodes harvest  postoperative radiation (ND $\geq$ 18, 44%). When adjusted for relevant covariates, ND $\geq$ 18 demonstrated statistically significant improvements in overall survival for both DOI $<$ 4 mm and $\geq$4 mm (DOI $<$ 4 mm: HR 0.67, 95%CI 0.54–0.85; DOI $\geq$ 4 mm: HR 0.47, 95%CI 0.34–0.64). However, ND $<$ 18 showed no significant difference from observation of the neck regardless of DOI (DOI $<$ 4 mm: HR 0.82, 95%CI 0.63–1.07; DOI $\geq$ 4 mm: HR 0.72, 95%CI 0.51–1.03). Of patients undergoing END, the most significant factors associated with obtaining a nodal yield of 18 or more were age less than 40 years (HR 2.58, 95%CI 1.84–3.63) and treatment at an academic facility (HR 2.47, 95%CI 2.06–2.96). END with 18 or more nodes is associated with improved survival outcomes in patients with early stage OCSCC regardless of DOI. END with less than 18 nodes, however, does not appear significantly different than observation of the neck alone. Achieving a lymph node yield of 18 or more is multifactorial and includes both patient and provider factors. In 1994 a decision analysis, based on the literature and utility ratings for outcome by a panel of experienced head and neck physicians, was presented which showed a threshold probability of occult metastases of 20% to recommend elective treatment of the neck. It was stated that recommendations for the management of the cN0 neck are not immutable and should be reconfigured to determine the optimal management based on different sets of underlying assumptions. Although much has changed and is published in the almost 25 years after its publication, up to date this figure is still mentioned in the context of decisions on treatment of the clinically negative (cN0) neck. Therefore, we critically reviewed the developments in diagnostics and therapy and modeling approaches in the context of decisions on treatment of the cN0 neck. However, the results of studies on treatment of the cN0 neck cannot be translated to other settings due to significant differences in relevant variables such as population, culture, diagnostic work-up, follow-up, costs, institutional preferences and other factors. Moreover, patients may have personal preferences and may weigh oncologic outcomes versus morbidity and quality of life differently. Therefore, instead of trying to establish “the” best strategy for the cN0 neck or “the” optimal cut-off point for elective neck treatment, the approach to optimize the management of the cN0 neck would be to develop and implement models and decision support systems that can serve to optimize choices depending on individual, institutional, population and other relevant variables.;,citation_author=Karen T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Bayesian network model of lymphatic tumor progression for personalized elective CTV definition in head and neck cancers;,citation_abstract=Many tumors including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) spread along the lymphatic network. Current imaging modalities can only detect sufficiently large metastases. Therefore, adjacent lymph node levels (LNL) are irradiated electively since they may harbor microscopic tumors. We apply Bayesian Networks (BN) to model lymphatic tumor progression. The model can subsequently be used to personalize the risk estimation of microscopic lymph node metastases in newly diagnosed patients based on their distribution of macroscopic metastases. A BN is a graphical representation of a joint probability distribution. We represent LNLs by binary random variables corresponding to the BN nodes. Each LNL is associated with a hidden microscopic state and an observed macroscopic state (e.g. 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging). The primary tumor is represented by network input nodes. We demonstrate the concept for early T-stage oropharyngeal carcinomas and their spread to ipsilateral lymph node levels (LNL) Ib to IV. We show that the BN parameters can be efficiently learnt by merging pathology findings on microscopic tumor progression (which is limited to a few published studies) and imaging data on macroscopic tumor progression such as CT and 18F-FDG-PET (which are widely available in clinical practice). The trained network can be used to quantify how the distribution of macroscopic metastases impacts the probability of microscopic involvement of the remaining LNLs. The analysis suggests that the risk of microscopic involvement of level IV exceeds 5% only if level III harbors metastases. Excluding level IV from the elective CTV for other patients would reduce the integral dose delivered to the patient and potentially reduce acute and late side effects.;,citation_author=Bertrand Pouymayou;,citation_author=Panagiotis Balermpas;,citation_author=Oliver Riesterer;,citation_author=Matthias Guckenberger;,citation_author=Jan Unkelbach;,citation_publication_date=2019-08;,citation_cover_date=2019-08;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=16;,citation_doi=10.1088/1361-6560/ab2a18;,citation_issn=1361-6560;,citation_volume=64;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Physics in Medicine &amp;amp;amp; Biology;,citation_publisher=IOP Publishing;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Survival of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in relation to human papillomavirus infection: Review and meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=Abstract Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), especially of the oropharynx, with highest distribution in the tonsils. HPV infection has been associated with improved outcome, although not all the studies show consistent results. The reason for this is not clear. We reviewed all published articles and conducted a meta-analysis on the overall relationship between HPV infection and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in HNSCC. Patients with HPV-positive HNSCC had a lower risk of dying (meta HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.7–1.0), and a lower risk of recurrence (meta HR: 0.62, 95%CI: 0.5–0.8) than HPV-negative HNSCC patients. Site-specific analyses show that patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal tumours had a 28% reduced risk of death (meta HR: 0.72, 95%CI: 0.5–1.0) in comparison to patients with HPV-negative oropharyngeal tumours. Similar observations were made for DFS (meta HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.4–0.7). There was no difference in OS between HPV-positive and negative non-oropharyngeal patients. The observed improved OS and DFS for HPV-positive HNSCC patients is specific to the oropharynx; these tumours may have a distinct etiology from those tumours in non-oropharyngeal sites. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;,citation_author=Camille C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Dynamic Programming Approach to Adaptive Fractionation;,citation_abstract=We conduct a theoretical study of various solution methods for the adaptive fractionation problem. The two messages of this paper are: (i) dynamic programming (DP) is a useful framework for adaptive radiation therapy, particularly adaptive fractionation, because it allows us to assess how close to optimal different methods are, and (ii) heuristic methods proposed in this paper are near-optimal, and therefore, can be used to evaluate the best possible benefit of using an adaptive fraction size. The essence of adaptive fractionation is to increase the fraction size when the tumor and organ-at-risk (OAR) are far apart (a &amp;amp;amp;quot;favorable&amp;quot; anatomy) and to decrease the fraction size when they are close together. Given that a fixed prescribed dose must be delivered to the tumor over the course of the treatment, such an approach results in a lower cumulative dose to the OAR when compared to that resulting from standard fractionation. We first establish a benchmark by using the DP algorithm to solve the problem exactly. In this case, we characterize the structure of an optimal policy, which provides guidance for our choice of heuristics. We develop two intuitive, numerically near-optimal heuristic policies, which could be used for more complex, high-dimensional problems. Furthermore, one of the heuristics requires only a statistic of the motion probability distribution, making it a reasonable method for use in a realistic setting. Numerically, we find that the amount of decrease in dose to the OAR can vary significantly (5 - 85%) depending on the amount of motion in the anatomy, the number of fractions, and the range of fraction sizes allowed. In general, the decrease in dose to the OAR is more pronounced when: (i) we have a high probability of large tumor-OAR distances, (ii) we use many fractions (as in a hyper-fractionated setting), and (iii) we allow large daily fraction size deviations.;,citation_author=Jagdish Ramakrishnan;,citation_author=David Craft;,citation_author=Thomas Bortfeld;,citation_author=John N Tsitsiklis;,citation_publication_date=2012-03;,citation_cover_date=2012-03;,citation_year=2012;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4524;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1088/0031-9155/55/5/1203;,citation_issn=0031-9155, 1361-6560;,citation_volume=57;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Physics in Medicine and Biology;">

We aimed to study the incidence of metastasis to the submandibular gland (SMG) and to establish the oncologic basis of SMG preservation in early-stage cancer of the oral cavity (OSCC). Methods. This was a retrospective study of 261 patients with OSCC treated primarily with surgery at a tertiary medical center. One hundred thirty-two early-stage (T1-2, N0) OSCCs were further analyzed. Results. The mean age was 59 years with male-to-female sex ratio of 1.4:1. Two hundred sixty-one neck dissections were performed with SMG removal in 253 patients. One patient with an advanced floor of mouth cancer had obvious infiltration of the SMG. Only 2.5% (3 of 116) patients with early-stage OSCC had level I metastasis; none had SMG metastases. Conclusion. SMG preservation in early cancers (T1-2, N0) of the oral cavity should be feasible unless there is evidence of direct invasion of the gland or close proximity of the cancer to it. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=CLASSIFICATION OF NECK DISSECTION: Current Concepts and Future Considerations;,citation_abstract=In an attempt to develop neck dissection procedures that more specifically addressed early stage neck metastases, a number of variations and modifications of the classical radical neck dissection have been developed. Consequently, most contemporary surgeons employ a wider repertoire of techniques for removing nodal metastases. Concurrent with this growth in surgical options, a multitude of terms used to describe such procedures also emerged. Under most circumstances, these were originally proposed by individual authors without any uniformity of terminology and thus lacked any form of standardization. Unfortunately, this often resulted in redundancy, misinterpretation, and even confusion among clinicians. Realizing the importance for standardizing the diverse nomenclature, the Committee for Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology of the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) convened a special task force to address the terminology problems related to cervical lymphadenectomy. The specific objectives of the group were: (1) to recommend terminology that adhered to more traditional terms such as “radical” and “modified radical” neck dissection and to avoid the use of eponyms and acronyms; (2) to define which lymphatic structures and other nonlymphatic structures should be removed or preserved relative to the radical neck dissection; (3) to provide standard nomenclature for the lymph node groups and nonlymphatic structures;(4) to define the boundaries of resection for lymph node groups; (5) to use terms for the neck dissection procedures that are basic and easy to understand; and (6) to develop a classification based on the biology of the cervical metastases and the principles of oncologic surgery.8;,citation_author=K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Standardizing Neck Dissection Terminology: Official Report of the Academy’s Committee for Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology;,citation_abstract=$\bullet$ The emergence of the multitude of modified techniques for neck dissection procedure has resulted in a nomenclature system that is nonuniform. To eliminate potential misinterpretation, overlap, and lack of standardization, the Academy’s Committee for Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology, with input from the Education Committee of the American Society of Head and Neck Surgery, has developed a classification system for these procedures. This has now been adopted by the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery. The classification is based on the following concepts: (1) radical neck dissection is the fundamental procedure with which all other neck dissections are compared, (2) modified radical neck dissection denotes preservation of one or more nonlymphatic structure(s), (3) selective neck dissection denotes preservation of one or more group(s) of lymph nodes, and (4) extended radical neck dissection denotes removal of one or more additional lymphatic and/or nonlymphatic structure(s). Adherence to the principles of this classification system to describe neck dissection techniques should provide an improved method of communication. Furthermore, the system provides a rational framework on which subsequent terminology can be added.(Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1991;117:601-605);,citation_author=K. T.

Precise diagnostic assessment of tumour extension in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is of critical importance for ensuring that patients receive proper treatment. Preliminary studies have shown divergent results of PET/CT in diagnosis and staging of HNSCC. The aims of this study were (1) to systematically review and meta-analyse published data about the diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT for diagnosing patients with HNSCC and (2) to compare the diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT with that of standard conventional imaging (SCI). Methods A systematic literature search in the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases on publications of PET/CT diagnostics of HNSCC from January 2005 to July 2013 was carried out. All retrieved studies were reviewed and qualitatively analysed. Along with the calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT and SCI, bubble- and summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) plots were created. Findings Two meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy were conducted. The first, on PET/CT, included 987 patients distributed across nine studies. The second, on SCI, included 517 patients participating in a total of six studies among those comparing PET/CT to SCI. The meta-analyses showed a pooled sensitivity of 89.3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 83.4–93.2%) and specificity of 89.5% (95% CI: 82.9–93.7%) for PET/CT and correspondingly, a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 71.6% (95% CI: 44.3–88.9%) and 78.0% (95%CI: 30.2–96.7%) for SCI.

The application-specific cost is minimized subject to a constraint on the randomness of the solution, which is gradually lowered. We emphasize the intuition gained from analogy to statistical physics. Alternatively the method is derived within rate-distortion theory, where the annealing process is equivalent to computation of Shannon’s rate-distortion function, and the annealing temperature is inversely proportional to the slope of the curve. The basic algorithm is extended by incorporating structural constraints to allow optimization of numerous popular structures including vector quantizers, decision trees, multilayer perceptrons, radial basis functions, and mixtures of experts.;,citation_author=K.

The 501 patients underwent 516 radical neck dissections. Patients were grouped by clinical neck status at the time of neck dissection: elective dissection (ED) in the NO neck, immediate therapeutic dissection (ITD) in the N+ neck, and subsequent therapeutic dissection (STD) in the neck observed which converted clinically to N+. Pathologically identified NM occurred 34% of the time in ED, 69% in ITD and 90% in STD. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of the clinical exam was 70%, 65%, and 68%, respectively. Detailed analysis was performed for each group based on the primary site. This revealed a prevalence of NM in level IV of 3% (five of 167) for ED versus 17% (49/ 296) for ITD + STD (P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prospective Phase 2 Study of Radiation Therapy Dose and Volume De-escalation for Elective Neck Treatment of Oropharyngeal and Laryngeal Cancer;,citation_abstract=Purpose The required elective nodal dose and volumes for head and neck intensity modulated radiation therapy have largely been extrapolated from conventional radiation therapy fields. In this prospective, dual-center, phase 2 study, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of reduced elective nodal volume and dose in oropharyngeal and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Methods and Materials Patients with newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and larynx were eligible for enrollment. Each lymph node was characterized as involved or suspicious based on imaging criteria. For oropharynx cancer, only involved and immediately adjacent stations were treated to 40 Gy in 20 fractions. In larynx patients, at least bilateral levels II and III were treated to 40 Gy, with level IV treated only if level III was involved. Involved and suspicious nodes were then boosted with 30 Gy and 24 Gy in 15 fractions, respectively. Concurrent chemotherapy was required for stage T3N0-1 and IVA/B patients. The primary endpoint of the study was solitary elective volume recurrence, with secondary endpoints including patterns of failure and patient-reported outcomes. Results A total of 72 (51 oropharynx, 21 larynx) patients completed treatment on this trial from January 2017 through November 2018. The stages at presentations were 5, 17, and 50 stage I-II, III, and IV, respectively, with 90% treated with chemoradiation therapy. At a median follow-up of 24.7 months for surviving patients, there have been no solitary elective nodal recurrences. Seven patients developed a nodal recurrence, 5 of which were in-field and 2 were elective with synchronous in-field recurrence. Patient-reported outcomes assessment at 1 year showed superior or equivalent outcomes compared with baseline, except for saliva and taste measures. Conclusions The results of this trial suggest that elective dose and volume reduction is oncologically sound for oropharyngeal and laryngeal cancer treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy, with promising quality-of-life outcomes.;,citation_author=David J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Molecular Mechanisms of Radiation-Induced Cancer Cell Death: A Primer;,citation_abstract=Radiation therapy (RT) is responsible for at least 40% of cancer cures, however treatment resistance remains a clinical problem. There have been recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of radiation-induced cell death. The type of cell death after radiation depends on a number of factors including cell type, radiation dose and quality, oxygen tension, TP53 status, DNA repair capacity, cell cycle phase at time of radiation exposure, and the microenvironment. Mitotic catastrophe (a pathway preceding cell death that happens in mitosis or as a consequence of aberrant mitotic progression) is the primary context of radiation-induced cell death in solid cancers, although in a small subset of cancers such as haematopoietic malignancies, radiation results in immediate interphase apoptosis, occurring within hours after exposure. There is intense therapeutic interest in using stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR), a precise, high-dose form of RT given in a small number of fractions, to prime the immune system for cancer cell killing, but the optimal radiation dose and fractionation remain unclear. Additionally, promising novel radiosensitisers targeting the cell cycle and DNA repair pathways are being trialled. In the context of the increasing use of SABR and such novel agents in the clinic, we provide an updated primer on the major types of radiation-induced cell death, focussing on their molecular mechanisms, factors affecting their initiation, and their implications on immunogenicity.;,citation_author=Joseph Sia;,citation_author=Radoslaw Szmyd;,citation_author=Eric Hau;,citation_author=Harriet E.

It is put into an experimental cage for a few minutes each day. A food hopper attached to the cage may be swung into place so that the pigeon can eat from it. A solenoid and a timing relay hold the hopper in place for 5 sec at each reinforcement. If a clock is now arranged to present the food hopper at regular intervals with no reference whatsoever to the bird’s behavior, operant conditioning usually takes place. The bird tends to learn whatever response it is making when the hopper appears. The response may be extinguished and reconditioned. The experiment might be said to demonstrate a sort of superstition. The bird behaves as if there were a causal relation between its behavior and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=PET/CT Poorly Predicts AJCC 8th Edition Pathologic Staging in HPV-Related Oropharyngeal Cancer;,citation_abstract=Objective The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition introduced distinct clinical and pathological staging paradigms for human papilloma virus positive (HPV+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Treatment planning for OPSCC often utilizes positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to assess clinical stage. We hypothesize that PET/CT will accurately predict final pathologic AJCC 8th edition staging in patients with HPV+ OPSCC. Methods All patients with primary HPV+ OPSCC with preoperative PET/CT who underwent transoral robotic surgery and neck dissection between 2011 and 2017 were identified. Data were collected via chart review. Two neuroradiologists performed blinded re-evaluation of all scans. Primary tumor size and cervical nodal disease characteristics were recorded and TNM staging was extrapolated. Cohen’s kappa statistic was used to assess interrater reliability. Test for symmetry was performed to analyze discordance between radiologic and pathologic staging. Results Forty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Interrater reliability was substantial between radiologists for nodal (N) and overall staging (OS) ($\kappa~$=&nbsp;0.715 and 0.715). Radiologist A review resulted in identical OS for 67% of patients, overstaging for 31%, and understaging for 2%. Radiologist B review resulted in 61% identical OS, 39% overstaging, and 0% understaging. In misclassified cases, the test of symmetry shows strong bias toward overstaging N stage and OS ( P  $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .001). Radiologic interpretation of extracapsular extension showed poor interrater reliability ($\kappa~$=&nbsp;0.403) and poor accuracy. Conclusion PET/CT predicts a higher nodal and overall stage than pathologic staging. PET/CT should not be relied upon for initial tumor staging, as increased FDG uptake is not specific for nodal metastases. PET/CT is shown to be a poor predictor of ECE.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acute and chronic neuromuscular adaptations to local vibration training;,citation_abstract=Vibratory stimuli are thought to have the potential to promote neural and/or muscular (re)conditioning. This has been well described for whole-body vibration (WBV), which is commonly used as a training method to improve strength and/or functional abilities. Yet, this technique may present some limitations, especially in clinical settings where patients are unable to maintain an active position during the vibration exposure. Thus, a local vibration (LV) technique, which consists of applying portable vibrators directly over the tendon or muscle belly without active contribution from the participant, may present an alternative to WBV. The purpose of this narrative review is (1) to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature related to the acute and chronic neuromuscular changes associated with LV, and (2) to show that LV training may be an innovative and efficient alternative method to the “classic” training programs, including in the context of muscle deconditioning prevention or rehabilitation. An acute LV application (one bout of 20–60&nbsp;min) may be considered as a significant neuromuscular workload, as demonstrated by an impairment of force generating capacity and LV-induced neural changes. Accordingly, it has been reported that a training period of LV is efficient in improving muscular performance over a wide range of training (duration, number of session) and vibration (frequency, amplitude, site of application) parameters. The functional improvements are principally triggered by adaptations within the central nervous system. A model illustrating the current research on LV-induced adaptations is provided.;,citation_author=Robin Souron;,citation_author=Thibault Besson;,citation_author=Guillaume Y.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Eight weeks of local vibration training increases dorsiflexor muscle cortical voluntary activation;,citation_abstract=The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an 8-wk local vibration training (LVT) program on functional and corticospinal properties of dorsiflexor muscles. Forty-four young subjects were allocated to a training (VIB, n = 22) or control (CON, n = 22) group. The VIB group performed twenty-four 1-h sessions (3 sessions/wk) of 100-Hz vibration applied to the right tibialis anterior. Both legs were tested in each group before training (PRE), after 4 (MID) and 8 (POST) wk of training, and 2 wk after training (POST 2W ). Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque was assessed, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to evaluate cortical voluntary activation (VA TMS ), motor evoked potential (MEP), cortical silent period (CSP), and input-output curve parameters. MVC was significantly increased for VIB at MID for right and left legs [+7.4% ( P = 0.001) and +6.2% ( P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.01), respectively] and remained significantly greater than PRE at POST [+12.0% ( P $&amp;lt;$ 0.001) and +10.1% ( P $<$ 0.001), respectively]. VA TMS was significantly increased for right and left legs at MID [+4.4% ( P $<$ 0.01) and +4.7% ( P $<$ 0.01), respectively] and at POST [+4.9% ( P = 0.001) and +6.2% ( P = 0.001), respectively]. These parameters remained enhanced in both legs at POST 2W . MEP and CSP recorded during MVC and input-output curve parameters did not change at any time point for either leg. Despite no changes in excitability or inhibition being observed, LVT seems to be a promising method to improve strength through an increase of maximal voluntary activation, i.e., neural adaptations. Local vibration may thus be further considered for clinical or aging populations. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY The effects of a local vibration training program on cortical voluntary activation measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation were assessed for the first time in dorsiflexors, a functionally important muscle group. We observed that training increased maximal voluntary strength likely because of the strong and repeated activation of Ia spindle afferents during vibration training that led to changes in the cortico-motoneuronal pathway, as demonstrated by the increase in cortical voluntary activation.;,citation_author=Robin Souron;,citation_author=Adrien Farabet;,citation_author=Léonard Féasson;,citation_author=Alain Belli;,citation_author=Guillaume Y.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Patterns of Nodal Metastases and Predictors of Occult Disease in HPV-Associated Oropharynx Cancer;,citation_abstract=Objective For human papilloma virus–associated oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma (HPV+ OPSCC), we evaluated the distribution of neck-level lymph node (LN) metastasis, based on postsurgical histopathology, and the incidence of and risk factors for occult LN metastases, as these patterns need clarification for this newer cancer subset. Study Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting National Cancer Database (NCDB). Methods We analyzed 2358 patients in the NCDB with HPV+ OPSCC who underwent neck dissection (ND) from 2010 to 2015. Incidence and distribution of LN metastases were calculated for neck levels I to V. Variables associated with occult LN metastasis were assessed by multivariate logistic regression. Results In therapeutic NDs (n = 1935), the following proportions of positive LNs were found: level I, 9.0% (n = 175); level II, 81.0% (n = 1568); level III, 29.6% (n = 573); level IV, 11.9% (n = 230); and level V, 4.9% (n = 95). In elective NDs (n = 423), occult-positive LNs were found in 35.8% (n = 152), with the following proportions by level: level I, 3.3% (n = 14); level II, 26.9% (n = 114); level III, 8.7% (n = 37); level IV, 4.0% (n = 17); and level V, 0.2% (n = 1). The presence of occult LNs was independently associated with a Charlson-Deyo score of 1 (odds ratio, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.18-4.31; P =. 014) and lymphovascular invasion (odds ratio, 5.91; 95% CI, 3.21-11.18; P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$. 001). Occult LN metastases were not significantly associated with pT classification, primary site, or number of LNs resected. Conclusion For HPV+ OPSCC, occult nodal disease is common.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=PET/CT in Surgical Planning for Head and Neck Cancer;,citation_abstract=Fluorine-18 (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography fused with computed tomography (PET/CT) is a valuable tool in surgical planning for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). If performed prior to biopsy or other surgical intervention, FDG-PET/CT has high sensitivity for the detection of the primary site in patients with cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary origin and can be used to direct the surgical workup. FDG-PET/CT is superior to CT alone for detection of nodal metastases outside the expected pattern or distant metastases or second primary cancers and can greatly affect determination of appropriate management including surgical eligibility. Prior to the advent of PET/CT, many patients undergoing (chemo)radiation-based therapy had planned post-treatment neck dissection; FDG-PET/CT now has a proven role in the evaluation of recurrent or persistent disease amenable to salvage surgery and enables safe avoidance of planned postradiation neck dissection with a high negative predictive value. Specifically for this important application, two standardized reporting metrics may be used in the head and neck anatomic region: the “Hopkins criteria” and the “Neck Imaging Reporting and Data System”; both systems produce a formalized evaluation and recommendation based on PET/CT findings. The role of PET/CT as a replacement for elective neck dissection or examination under anesthesia remains controversial but deserves further study. FDG-PET/CT has a wide-ranging impact on the surgical management of patients with HNSCC and should be used routinely in patients with unknown primary nodal disease and those presenting with advanced-stage cancers at initial staging and to assess treatment response.;,citation_author=Madeleine P.

Materials and methods Consecutive patients of well-lateralised OCC treated between 2012 and 2017 were included. The primary endpoint was incidence of CLNR and CLNRFS. Univariable and multivariable analyses were carried out to identify potential factors predicting CLNR. Results Of the 208 eligible patients, 21 (10%) developed isolated CLNR at a median follow-up of 45 months. The incidence of CLNR was 21.3% in node-positive patients. CLNR was most common at level IB (61.9%) followed by level II. The 5-year CLNRFS and overall survival were 82.5% and 57.7%, respectively. Any positive ipsilateral lymph node (P = 0.001), two or more positive lymph nodes (P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001), involvement of ipsilateral level IB (P = 0.002) or level II lymph node (P $&amp;lt;$ 0.001), presence of extranodal extension (P $<$ 0.001), lymphatic invasion (P = 0.015) and perineural invasion (P = 0.021) were significant factors for CLNR on univariable analysis. The presence of two or more positive lymph nodes (P $<$ 0.001) was an independent prognostic factor for CLNR on multivariable analysis. CLNR increased significantly with each increasing lymph node number beyond two compared with node-negative patients. Conclusion The overall incidence of isolated CLNR is low in well-lateralised OCC.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The role of computational methods for automating and improving clinical target volume definition;,citation_abstract=Treatment planning in radiotherapy distinguishes three target volume concepts: the gross tumor volume (GTV), the clinical target volume (CTV), and the planning target volume (PTV). Over time, GTV definition and PTV margins have improved through the development of novel imaging techniques and better image guidance, respectively. CTV definition is sometimes considered the weakest element in the planning process. CTV definition is particularly complex since the extension of microscopic disease cannot be seen using currently available in-vivo imaging techniques. Instead, CTV definition has to incorporate knowledge of the patterns of tumor progression. While CTV delineation has largely been considered the domain of radiation oncologists, this paper, arising from a 2019 ESTRO Physics research workshop, discusses the contributions that medical physics and computer science can make by developing computational methods to support CTV definition. First, we overview the role of image segmentation algorithms, which may in part automate CTV delineation through segmentation of lymph node stations or normal tissues representing anatomical boundaries of microscopic tumor progression. The recent success of deep convolutional neural networks has also enabled learning entire CTV delineations from examples. Second, we discuss the use of mathematical models of tumor progression for CTV definition, using as example the application of glioma growth models to facilitate GTV-to-CTV expansion for glioblastoma that is consistent with neuroanatomy. We further consider statistical machine learning models to quantify lymphatic metastatic progression of tumors, which may eventually improve elective CTV definition. Lastly, we discuss approaches to incorporate uncertainty in CTV definition into treatment plan optimization as well as general limitations of the CTV concept in the case of infiltrating tumors without natural boundaries.;,citation_author=Jan Unkelbach;,citation_author=Thomas Bortfeld;,citation_author=Carlos E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=18F-FDG-PET/CT-based treatment planning for definitive (chemo)radiotherapy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma improves regional control and survival;,citation_abstract=Background and purpose Multimodality imaging including 18F-FDG-PET has improved the detection threshold of nodal metastases in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The aim of this retrospective analysis is to investigate the impact of FDG-PET/CT-based nodal target volume definition (FDG-PET/CT-based NTV) on radiotherapy outcomes, compared to conventional CT-based nodal target volume definition (CT-based NTV). Materials and methods Six-hundred-thirty-three patients treated for HNSCC with definitive (chemo)radiotherapy using IMRT/VMAT techniques between 2008 and 2017 were analyzed. FDG-PET/CT-based NTV was performed in 46% of the patients. The median follow-up was 31 months. Diagnostic imaging depicting the regional recurrence was co-registered with the initial CT-scan to reconstruct the exact site of the recurrence. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with radiotherapy outcome. Results FDG-PET/CT-based NTV improved control of disease in the CTVelective-nodal (HR: 0.33, p = 0.026), overall regional control (HR: 0.62, p = 0.027) and overall survival (HR: 0.71, p = 0.033) compared to CT-based NTV. The risk for recurrence in the CTVelective-nodal was increased in case of synchronous local recurrence of the primary tumor (HR: 12.4, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001). Conclusion FDG-PET/CT-based NTV significantly improved control of disease in the CTVelective-nodal, overall regional control and overall survival compared to CT-based NTV. A significant proportion of CTVelective-nodal recurrences are potentially new nodal manifestations from a synchronous local recurrent primary tumor.

Tumour- and patient-related clinical variables were considered in a machine learning pipeline to predict overall survival (primary end-point) and local and regional tumour control (secondary end-points); serially, imaging features were considered for optional model improvement. Finally, patients were stratified into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups. RESULTS: Performance score, AJCC8thstage, pack-years, and Age were identified as predictors for overall survival, demonstrating good performance in both the training cohort (c-index&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.72 [95% CI, 0.66-0.77]) and in all three validation cohorts (c-indices: 0.76 [0.69-0.83], 0.73 [0.68-0.77], and 0.75 [0.68-0.80]). Excellent stratification of patients with HNC into high, intermediate, and low mortality risk was achieved; with 5-year overall survival rates of 17-46% for the high-risk group compared to 92-98% for the low-risk group. The addition of morphological image feature further improved the performance (c-index&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.73 [0.64-0.81]). These models are integrated in a clinic-ready interactive web interface: https://uic-evl.github.io/hnc-predictor/ CONCLUSIONS: Robust model-based prediction was able to stratify patients with HNC in distinct high, intermediate, and low mortality risk groups. This can effectively be capitalised for personalised radiotherapy, e.g., for tumour radiation dose escalation/de-escalation.;,citation_author=Lisanne V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography–based Lymph Node Atlas for Salvage Radiotherapy in Patients with Recurrent Prostate Cancer: A Validation of the New NRG Oncology 2020 guideline;,citation_abstract=Background Approximately 20–40% of patients with prostate cancer (PC) who undergo radical prostatectomy (RP) experience relapse, with the majority of these cases developing pelvic lymph node (LN) metastases. Taking new data from the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) era into account, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 2009 contouring guideline for the pelvic LNs from 2009 was updated by the NRG Oncology group in 2020 (NRG 2020). Objective To evaluate and validate the updated NRG 2020 guideline with our established LN atlas. Design, setting, and participants We screened 1653 PSMA PET/computed tomography (CT) data sets for patients with biochemical relapse who underwent a PET scan between November 2012 and November 2017. After screening, we developed an LN atlas using data from 233 patients. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis We evaluated LN overlap (OL) with the RTOG 2009 and NRG 2020 contouring guidelines. OL was defined as within ($&amp;amp;amp;gt;$90%), partly within (10–90%), or outside ($&amp;lt;$10%). Results and limitations In comparison to the RTOG 2009 guideline, 403 (52%), 134 (17%), and 241 (31%) of the LNs were not, were partly, or were fully covered within the overall group, respectively. By contrast, using the NRG 2020 guideline, 302 (39%), 190 (24%), and 286 (37%) of the LNs were not, were partly, or were fully covered, respectively (p&nbsp;$&amp;lt;~$0.001). Limitations include the retrospective design with missing data and no histopathological confirmation of the PET results. Conclusions The updated NRG 2020 contouring guideline improves coverage of the pelvic LNs in patients undergoing salvage radiation therapy. However, PET/CT should be considered whenever possible to ensure coverage of untypical LN spread. Patient summary We compared the 2009 and 2020 guidelines on the radiation area for the pelvis for patients with recurrent prostate cancer that has spread to lymph nodes. The newer guideline provides better coverage of pelvic lymph nodes than the older one and is useful in planning radiation therapy. However, a scan of the pelvis using the newest technique should be considered for individual patients to ensure coverage of untypical lymph nodes.;,citation_author=Marco M. E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Deep Learning and Registration-Based Mapping for Analyzing the Distribution of Nodal Metastases in Head and Neck Cancer Cohorts: Informing Optimal Radiotherapy Target Volume Design;,citation_abstract=We introduce a deep-learning- and a registration-based method for automatically analyzing the spatial distribution of nodal metastases (LNs) in head and neck (H/N) cancer cohorts to inform radiotherapy (RT) target volume design. The two methods are evaluated in a cohort of 193 H/N patients/planning CTs with a total of 449 LNs. In the deep learning method, a previously developed nnU-Net 3D/2D ensemble model is used to autosegment 20 H/N levels, with each LN subsequently being algorithmically assigned to the closest-level autosegmentation. In the nonrigid-registration-based mapping method, LNs are mapped into a calculated template CT representing the cohort-average patient anatomy, and kernel density estimation is employed to estimate the underlying average 3D-LN probability distribution allowing for analysis and visualization without prespecified level definitions. Multireader assessment by three radio-oncologists with majority voting was used to evaluate the deep learning method and obtain the ground-truth distribution. For the mapping technique, the proportion of LNs predicted by the 3D probability distribution for each level was calculated and compared to the deep learning and ground-truth distributions. As determined by a multireader review with majority voting, the deep learning method correctly categorized all 449 LNs to their respective levels. Level 2 showed the highest LN involvement (59.0%). The level involvement predicted by the mapping technique was consistent with the ground-truth distribution (p for difference 0.915). Application of the proposed methods to multicenter cohorts with selected H/N tumor subtypes for informing optimal RT target volume design is promising.;,citation_author=Thomas Weissmann;,citation_author=Sina Mansoorian;,citation_author=Matthias Stefan May;,citation_author=Sebastian Lettmaier;,citation_author=Daniel Höfler;,citation_author=Lisa Deloch;,citation_author=Stefan Speer;,citation_author=Matthias Balk;,citation_author=Benjamin Frey;,citation_author=Udo S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modelling Lymphatic Metastatic Progression in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma;,citation_abstract=Radiotherapy plays a major role in the treatment of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC). Because of the frequent spread to regional lymph nodes in the head and neck region, some parts of the neck are irradiated prophylactically in addition to the primary tumor and macroscopic lymph node levels. Current guidelines define this clinical target volume based on overall prevalences of lymph node metastases in the lymph node levels (LNL) and only partially consider the patient-specific clinical diagnosis. This work describes the observed lymph node involvement patterns and dependence on clinicopathological factors such as T-category and extension of the primary tumor over the mid-saggital plane, it further models the lymphatic metastatic progression in OCSCC patients with the help of a previously developed but further enhanced hidden Markov model that can estimate the risk of microscopic disease in the LNLs given a individual patient’s clinical diagnosis. Based on the model’s risk predictions a more personalized elective target volume definition is supported. Our analysis showed the possibility of sparing ipsilateral LNL III for a clinically classified N0 patient and contralateral LNLs in patients without a primary tumor extending over the mid-saggital plane. Additionally, LNL IV is rarely involved on the ipsilateral and contralateral side. Therefore, the model may support future clinical trials on volume de-escalation strategies in radiotherapy of OCSCC patients.;,citation_author=Lars Widmer;,citation_publication_date=2023-09;,citation_cover_date=2023-09;,citation_year=2023;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_dissertation_institution=University of Zurich;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pathways Targeting Tumor Lymphangiogenesis;,citation_abstract=Abstract Tumor metastasis to sentinel lymph nodes represents the first step of tumor dissemination in most human cancers and serves as a major prognostic indicator for disease progression. Recent studies have revealed that tumors can actively induce the formation of lymphatic vessels, and that tumor lymphangiogenesis is correlated with lymph node metastasis in experimental cancer models and in several types of human cancers. Metastatic tumor cells may continue to promote lymphatic vessel growth even after their metastasis to sentinel lymph nodes, likely promoting further cancer spread. Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and VEGF-D were the first specific lymphangiogenesis factors identified, acting predominantly via VEGF receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) that is expressed by lymphatic endothelial cells, and a large number of clinical studies have shown a correlation between tumor expression of VEGF-C or VEGF-D and lymph node metastasis. VEGFR-3 activation promotes lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT, and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1/2 pathways. Additional tumor lymphangiogenesis factors have been recently identified, including VEGF-A. Importantly, blockade of the VEGFR-3 pathway by specific antibodies, by soluble receptor constructs, and by small molecule kinase inhibitors efficiently inhibits experimental tumor lymphangiogenesis and metastasis and might also represent a novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment of human cancers.;,citation_author=Christoph Wissmann;,citation_author=Michael Detmar;,citation_publication_date=2006-12;,citation_cover_date=2006-12;,citation_year=2006;,citation_issue=23;,citation_doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1800;,citation_issn=1078-0432, 1557-3265;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Clinical Cancer Research;">

The histological frequency and distribution of cervical lymph node metastases was studied in 326 neck dissections from 253 patients with an intraoral/oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Metastasis was evident in 118 patients (47%) and 18 had bilateral metastasis. For primary sites other than the tongue, metastasis developed initially in a node(s) in the first drainage group (level I or II) with progressive involvement of neighbouring nodes (“overflow”). Simultaneous bilateral metastases were seen in some tumours of the floor of mouth, tongue and oropharynx which involved the midline. An erratic distribution of metastases suggestive of “fast-tracking” (skip lesions and peppering) was only seen in tongue tumours. The pattern of metastatic spread indicates that level IV nodes must be included in staging and therapeutic neck dissections in tongue cancer.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relation between the level of lymph node metastasis and survival in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND The current head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) staging system may not capture the full prognostic implications of regional lymph node involvement. This study investigated the impact of the level of lymph node metastasis (LNM) on survival. METHODS The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry was queried for oral cavity (OC), oropharynx (OP), larynx (LAR), and hypopharynx (HP) HNSCC. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate whether the level of LNM was an independent prognostic factor. Site-specific recursive-partitioning analysis was performed to classify patients into different risk groups. RESULTS In all, 14,499 patients, including OC (n = 2463), OP (n = 8567), LAR (n = 2332), and HP patients (n = 1137), were analyzed. Both the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) N classification and the level of LNM showed significant effects on overall survival (OS) in patients with OC, OP, or LAR HNSCC but not in patients with HP HNSCC. In patients with N2 disease, the AJCC subclassification (N2a, N2b, or N2c) was significantly associated with the OS of patients with OP and LAR HNSCC but not with the OS of patients with OC or HP HNSCC, whereas the level of LNM (primary, secondary, or tertiary) was significantly associated with the OS of patients with OC, OP, and LAR HNSCC but not HP HNSCC. With recursive-partitioning analysis, a simple, primary site–specific prognostic tool integrating the AJCC T and N classifications and the level of LNM was designed, and it could be easily used by health care providers in clinic.

Obtaining large number of probabilities from domain experts is too expensive and too time demanding in practice. A widely accepted solution to this problem is the assumption of independence of causal influences (ICI) which allows for parametric models that define conditional probability distributions using only a number of parameters that is linear in the number of causes. ICI models, such as the noisy-OR and the noisy-AND gates, have been widely used by practitioners. In this paper we propose PICI, probabilistic ICI, an extension of the ICI assumption that leads to more expressive parametric models.

Here, we analyze the subclonal structure of 94 tumor samples, covering the primary tumors, lymph node metastases (LNMs), and liver metastases from 10 CRC patients. We portray a high-resolution lymphatic metastatic map for CRC by dividing LNMs into paracolic, intermediate, and central subgroups. Among the 61 metastatic routes identified, 38 (62.3%) are initiated from the primary tumors, 22 (36.1%) from LNMs, and 1 from liver metastasis (1.6%). In 5 patients, we find 6 LNMs that reseed 2 or more LNMs. We summarize 3 diverse modes of metastasis in CRC and show that skip spreading of tumor cells within the lymphatic network is common.

We use a Dirichlet-multinomial model to accommodate different types of endpoints. At each interim, the go/no-go decision is made by evaluating a set of posterior probabilities of the events of interest, which is optimized to maximize power or minimize the number of patients under the null hypothesis. Unlike other existing Bayesian designs, the BOP2 design explicitly controls the type I error rate, thereby bridging the gap between Bayesian designs and frequentist designs. In addition, the stopping boundary of the BOP2 design can be enumerated prior to the onset of the trial. These features make the BOP2 design accessible to a wide range of users and regulatory agencies and particularly easy to implement in practice. Simulation studies show that the BOP2 design has favorable operating characteristics with higher power and lower risk of incorrectly terminating the trial than some existing Bayesian phase II designs.

        <p>Purpose: Current guidelines for elective nodal irradiation in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) recommend including large portions of the contralateral lymphatic system in the clinical target volume (CTV-N), even for lateralized tumors with no clinical lymph node involvement in the contralateral neck. This study introduces a probabilistic model of bilateral lymphatic tumor progression in OPSCC to estimate personalized risks of occult disease in specific lymph node levels (LNLs) based on clinical lymph node involvement, T-stage, and tumor lateralization.</p>
        <p>Methods: Building on a previously developed hidden Markov model for ipsilateral lymphatic spread, we extend the approach to contralateral neck involvement. The model represents LNLs I, II, III, IV, V, and VII on both sides of the neck as binary hidden variables (healthy or involved), connected via arcs representing spread probabilities. These probabilities are learned using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from a dataset of 833 OPSCC patients, enabling the model to reflect the underlying lymphatic progression dynamics.</p>
        <p>Results: The model accurately and precisely describes observed patterns of lymph node involvement with a compact set of interpretable parameters. Midline extension of the primary tumor is identified as the primary risk factor for contralateral involvement, with advanced T-stage and extensive ipsilateral involvement further increasing risk. The model highlights key hierarchical dependencies: occult disease in contralateral LNL III is highly unlikely if upstream LNL II is clinically negative, and in contralateral LNL IV, occult disease is exceedingly rare without LNL III involvement.</p>
        <p>Conclusions: This model offers an interpretable, probabilistic framework to inform personalized elective CTV-N volume reduction. For lateralized tumors that do not cross the midline, it suggests the contralateral neck may safely be excluded from elective irradiation. For tumors extending across the midline but with a clinically negative contralateral neck, elective irradiation could be limited to LNL II, reducing unnecessary exposure while maintaining oncological safety.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In treating head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with radiotherapy or surgery, both the primary tumor and clinically detected lymph node metastases are targeted. Current guidelines also include large portions of the neck in the elective clinical target volume (CTV-N) <span class="citation" data-cites="gregoire_ctbased_2003 gregoire_delineation_2014 gregoire_delineation_2018 eisbruch_intensitymodulated_2002 biau_selection_2019 chao_determination_2002 vorwerk_guidelines_2011 ferlito_elective_2009">(<a href="#ref-gregoire_ctbased_2003" role="doc-biblioref">Grégoire et al. 2003</a>, <a href="#ref-gregoire_delineation_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>, <a href="#ref-gregoire_delineation_2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>; <a href="#ref-eisbruch_intensitymodulated_2002" role="doc-biblioref">Eisbruch et al. 2002</a>; <a href="#ref-biau_selection_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Biau et al. 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-chao_determination_2002" role="doc-biblioref">Chao et al. 2002</a>; <a href="#ref-vorwerk_guidelines_2011" role="doc-biblioref">Vorwerk and Hess 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-ferlito_elective_2009" role="doc-biblioref">Ferlito, Silver, and Rinaldo 2009</a>)</span> to mitigate the risk of regional recurrences from untreated microscopic disease undetectable by in-vivo imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET). However, this approach must balance minimizing the risk of occult disease in the lymphatic drainage region against the toxicity of unnecessarily irradiating healthy tissue.</p>
<p>These CTV-N guidelines rely on anatomically defined lymph node levels (LNLs) <span class="citation" data-cites="gregoire_delineation_2014">(<a href="#ref-gregoire_delineation_2014" role="doc-biblioref">Grégoire et al. 2014</a>)</span> and the overall prevalence of lymph node metastases within these levels. They often recommend extensive irradiation of both sides of the neck. However, the general prevalence of metastasis in a given LNL does not correspond to an individual patient’s risk of occult disease in that region, which depends on their specific state of tumor progression. For example, a patient with no clinically detectable nodal disease (cN0) who has a small, clearly lateralized T1 tumor would receive the same contralateral CTV-N as a patient with significant ipsilateral nodal involvement and an advanced tumor crossing the mid-sagittal plane: Both patients receive elective irradiation of the contralateral LNLs II, III, and IVa <span class="citation" data-cites="biau_selection_2019">(<a href="#ref-biau_selection_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Biau et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>To better quantify individualized risk of occult disease, we previously developed an intuitive probabilistic hidden Markov model (HMM) <span class="citation" data-cites="ludwig_hidden_2021 ludwig_modelling_2023">(<a href="#ref-ludwig_hidden_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Ludwig et al. 2021</a>, <a href="#ref-ludwig_modelling_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>, originally based on a conceptually similar a Bayesian network model <span class="citation" data-cites="pouymayou_bayesian_2019">(<a href="#ref-pouymayou_bayesian_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Pouymayou et al. 2019</a>)</span>. However, these models have been limited to predicting ipsilateral nodal involvement. This work extends the model to include contralateral risk predictions, enabling more personalized radiation volume recommendations. By identifying patients with low contralateral risk, the model could guide reductions in contralateral CTV-N, thereby decreasing radiation-induced toxicity and improving quality of life.</p>

<h1>Data on Lymphatic Progression Patterns</h1>
<p>To develop models for lymphatic tumor progression for all relevant LNLs, including contralateral regions, we compiled a detailed dataset of 833 patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) <span class="citation" data-cites="ludwig_dataset_2022 ludwig_multicentric_2024">(<a href="#ref-ludwig_dataset_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Ludwig et al. 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-ludwig_multicentric_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Ludwig, Schubert, Barbatei, Bauwens, Werlen, et al. 2024</a>)</span>. The dataset includes lymph node involvement per LNL for each patient in tabular form, along with primary tumor and patient characteristics such as T-category, subsite, primary tumor lateralization, and HPV p16 status. Patient records were collected from four institutions, and an overview of patient characteristics is provided in <a href="#tbl-data-overview" class="quarto-xref">table&nbsp;1</a>.</p>
<p>Data from Inselspital Bern (ISB) and Centre Léon Bérard (CLB) consist exclusively of patients who underwent neck dissections. In contrast, the majority of patients from the University Hospital Zürich (USZ) and the Hospital Vall d’Hebron (HVH) were treated with definitive radiotherapy. Since surgical treatment is more common for early T-category patients, ISB and CLB datasets include a higher proportion of these cases compared to USZ and HVH. For 83 patients in the CLB dataset, the primary tumor’s lateralization was not reported.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-data-consensus">Consensus on Involvement Status</h2>
<p>Pathological involvement is available only for surgically treated patients and for the levels that were dissected. For non-surgical patients, involvement status is determined clinically, i.e.&nbsp;using imaging. To ensure uniformity in analysis, diagnostic information was synthesized into a consensus decision for each patient and LNL. This consensus reflects the most likely state of involvement and accounts for the sensitivity and specificity of various diagnostic modalities, as reported in the literature <span class="citation" data-cites="debondt_detection_2007 kyzas_18ffluorodeoxyglucose_2008">(<a href="#ref-debondt_detection_2007" role="doc-biblioref">De Bondt et al. 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-kyzas_18ffluorodeoxyglucose_2008" role="doc-biblioref">Kyzas et al. 2008</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The consensus process is detailed in <a href="#sec-consensus" class="quarto-xref">section&nbsp;10</a>. Briefly, pathological findings from neck dissections are treated as the gold standard, overriding any conflicting clinical diagnoses. For levels not dissected, PET-CT is typically the primary source for determining the most likely state of involvement.</p>

In <a href="#fig-data-strat" class="quarto-xref">figure&nbsp;1</a>, we illustrate the prevalence of contralateral LNL involvement, stratified by T-category, the number of ipsilaterally involved LNLs, and whether the tumor extends across the mid-sagittal plane.</p>

<section id="midline-extension" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="midline-extension">Midline Extension</h3>
<p>The bottom left panel of <a href="#fig-data-strat" class="quarto-xref">figure&nbsp;1</a> shows that tumors crossing the mid-sagittal plane have a substantially higher prevalence of contralateral involvement compared to clearly lateralized tumors. This aligns with the anatomy of the head and neck lymphatic system, which is symmetric, with no major lymph vessels crossing the midline. Interstitial fluids from the primary tumor, presumed to carry malignant cells, can merely diffuse to contralateral lymphatic vessels over short distances. Thus, contralateral spread is more likely when the tumor approaches or crosses the midline. <!-- citation(s) needed? or is this intuition good enough? --></p>
</section>
<section id="t-category" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="t-category">T-Category</h3>
<p>The top left panel shows a correlation between T-category and contralateral involvement, reflecting T-category’s role as a surrogate for the time elapsed between disease onset and diagnosis. Advanced T-category tumors (e.g., T4) generally represent a longer disease progression timeline, providing more opportunity for metastatic spread compared to smaller tumors (e.g., T1).</p>
</section>
<section id="ipsilateral-involvement" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ipsilateral-involvement">Ipsilateral Involvement</h3>
<p>The top right panel reveals a positive correlation between ipsilateral and contralateral metastases. Extensive ipsilateral involvement likely indicates a longer or faster disease progression. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that bulky ipsilateral nodal disease may reroute lymphatic drainage toward the contralateral side, potentially facilitating contralateral metastasis. <!-- citation needed? --></p>
</section>
<section id="interplay-of-risk-factors" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interplay-of-risk-factors">Interplay of Risk Factors</h3>
<p>Midline extension, T-category, and ipsilateral involvement are interrelated risk factors for contralateral metastasis. For instance, 45.56% of advanced T-category tumors exhibit midline extension compared to 6.13% of early T-category tumors. While the higher fraction of midline extensions in advanced T-category patients partially accounts for the higher contralateral metastasis rates, T-category itself and ipsilateral involvement also play an additional role.</p>
<p>The bottom right panel of <a href="#fig-data-strat" class="quarto-xref">figure&nbsp;1</a> isolates patients with lateralized tumors that do not cross the midline, further demonstrating these relationships. Among early T-category patients with no ipsilateral nodal involvement (levels I-V), only 1.85% (2 of 108 patients) show involvement in contralateral level II. This proportion increases to 6.73% (14 of 208) if ipsilateral level II is involved, to 14.29% (10 of 70) if ipsilateral levels II and III are involved, and further to 39.68% (25 of 63) for advanced T-category tumors with ipsilateral levels II and III involved.</p>

<p>Based on the observations in <a href="#sec-data-strat" class="quarto-xref">section&nbsp;2.3</a> above, any model predicting the risk of contralateral nodal involvement should account for the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Midline Extension:</strong> Tumors extending across the mid-sagittal plane should result in a significantly higher probability of contralateral metastases.</li>
<li><strong>T-Category and Disease Progression:</strong> Advanced T-category should correspond to an increased risk of nodal disease.

<p>This paper builds on the previously developed unilateral model for ipsilateral lymph node involvement presented in <span class="citation" data-cites="ludwig_modelling_2024">(<a href="#ref-ludwig_modelling_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Ludwig, Schubert, Barbatei, Bauwens, Hoffmann, et al. 2024</a>)</span>. Below, we briefly recap the unilateral model to introduce the notation required for extending the framework to a bilateral model, described in <a href="#sec-ext-to-contra" class="quarto-xref">section&nbsp;4</a>. For further details on the ipsilateral model, refer to earlier publications <span class="citation" data-cites="ludwig_hidden_2021 ludwig_modelling_2024">(<a href="#ref-ludwig_hidden_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Ludwig et al. 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-ludwig_modelling_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Ludwig, Schubert, Barbatei, Bauwens, Hoffmann, et al. 2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>We represent a patient’s state of involvement at an abstract time-step <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> as a vector of hidden binary random variables, where each component corresponds to a lymph node level (LNL):</p>
<p><span id="eq-state-def"><span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{X}[t] = \begin{pmatrix} X_v[t] \end{pmatrix} \qquad v \in \left\{ 1, 2, \ldots, V \right\}
\tag{1}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the number of LNLs the model considers. The values a LNL’s may take on are <span class="math inline">\(X_v[t] = 0\)</span> (<code>False</code>), meaning the LNL <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is healthy or free of metastatic disease, or <span class="math inline">\(X_v[t] = 1\)</span> (<code>True</code>), corresponding to some form of tumor presence (i.e., occult or macroscopic disease). In total, there are <span class="math inline">\(2^V\)</span> distinct possible lymphatic involvement patterns, which we enumerate from <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\xi}_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\xi}_{2^V} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}\)</span>. Each LNL’s state is observed via another binary random variable <span class="math inline">\(Z_v\)</span> that describes the clinical involvement of a LNL based on imaging: <span class="math inline">\(Z_v = 0\)</span> (<code>False</code>) indicates that the LNL <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is healthy based on clinical diagnosis, and <span class="math inline">\(Z_v = 1\)</span> (<code>True</code>) indicates that LNL <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> was classified as involved. <span class="math inline">\(X_v\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z_v\)</span> are connected through the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnositc modality.</p>
<p>Based on this, our HMM is fully described by defining the following three quantities:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A starting state <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}[t=0]\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> just before the patient’s tumor formed. In our case, this is always the state <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\xi}_0\)</span> where all LNLs are still healthy.</li>
<li>The <em>transition matrix</em> <span id="eq-trans-matrix"><span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{A} = \left( A_{ij} \right) = \big( P \left( \mathbf{X}[t+1] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_j \mid \mathbf{X}[t] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_i \right) \big)
\tag{2}\]</span></span> where the value at row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and column <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> represents the probability to transition from state <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\xi}_i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\xi}_j\)</span> during the time-step from <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span>. Note that we prohibit self-healing, meaning that during a transition, no LNL may change their state from <span class="math inline">\(X_v[t]=1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(X_v[t+1]=0\)</span>. Consequently, many elements of the transition matrix are zero.</li>
<li>Lastly, the <em>observation matrix</em> <span id="eq-obs-matrix"><span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{B} = \left( B_{ij} \right) = \big( P \left( \mathbf{Z} = \boldsymbol{\zeta}_j \mid \mathbf{X}[t_D] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_i \right) \big)
\tag{3}\]</span></span> where in row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and at column <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> we find the probability to <em>observe</em> a lymphatic involvement pattern <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Z} = \boldsymbol{\zeta}_j\)</span>, given that the true (but hidden) state of involvement at the time of diagnosis <span class="math inline">\(t_D\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}[t_D] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_i\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The transition matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is parameterized using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the underlying lymphatic network. Edges from the primary tumor to an LNL are associated with a probability <span class="math inline">\(b_v\)</span> for direct spread to LNL <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> during one time step. Arcs from a LNL <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> to a LNL <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> are parameterized with the probability rate <span class="math inline">\(t_{vr}\)</span> for inter-nodal progression. In this paper, we build on the DAG shown in <a href="#fig-full-graph" class="quarto-xref">figure&nbsp;2</a> which was obtained by maximizing the model evidence as described in <span class="citation" data-cites="ludwig_modelling_2024">(<a href="#ref-ludwig_modelling_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Ludwig, Schubert, Barbatei, Bauwens, Hoffmann, et al. 2024</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>We can evolve the distribution of all possible hidden states from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}[t=0] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_0\)</span> step by step, by successively multiplying this vector with the transition matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}[t+1] = \mathbf{X}[t] \cdot \mathbf{A}\)</span>. For later use, we define at this point a matrix <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\)</span> that collects these distributions for all considered time-steps:</p>
<p><span id="eq-lambda-matrix"><span class="math display">\[
\boldsymbol{\Lambda} = P \left( \mathbf{X} \mid \mathbf{t} \right) = \begin{pmatrix}
\boldsymbol{\pi}^\intercal \cdot \mathbf{A}^0 \\

\vdots \\
\boldsymbol{\pi}^\intercal \cdot \mathbf{A}^{t_\text{max}} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\tag{4}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Where the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th row in this matrix corresponds to the probability distribution over hidden states after <span class="math inline">\(t=k-1\)</span> time-steps.</p>
<p>At the time of diagnosis, <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq t_D \leq t_\text{max}\)</span>, we multiply the evolved state distribution with the observation matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> to obtain the distribution over all possible diagnoses. However, the exact time of diagnosis, <span class="math inline">\(t_D\)</span>, is unknown; that is, we do not know the number of time-steps over which the HMM should be evolved. To address this, we marginalize over all possible diagnosis times, allowing the diagnosis to occur at any time-step, albeit with different weights. These weights are defined by a prior distribution over <span class="math inline">\(t_D\)</span>, which can vary depending on the patient’s T-category. For example, the time-prior for early T-category patients, <span class="math inline">\(P(t_D \mid \text{early})\)</span>, may put more weight on earlier time-steps, reflecting – on average – earlier detection, compared to the prior for advanced T-category patients, <span class="math inline">\(P(t_D \mid \text{advanced})\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P\left( \mathbf{X} \mid \text{T}x = \text{early} \right) = \sum_{t=0}^{t_\text{max}} P \left( \mathbf{X} \mid t \right) \cdot P(t \mid \text{early})
\]</span></p>
<p>In this work, we use binomial distributions <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{B} \left( t_D, p_{\text{T}x} \right)\)</span> as time-priors which have one free parameter <span class="math inline">\(p_{\text{T}x}\)</span> for each group of patients we differentiate based on T-category. Also, we fix <span class="math inline">\(t_\text{max} = 10\)</span>, which means that the expected number of time-steps from the onset of a patient’s disease to their diagnosis is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}\left[ t_D \right] = 10 \cdot p_{\text{T}x}\)</span>.</p>

<p>The likelihood function for a patient to present with a diagnosis <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\zeta}_i\)</span> a T-category <span class="math inline">\(\text{T}x\)</span> tumor can now be written as:</p>
<p><span id="eq-single-patient-llh"><span class="math display">\[

<p>With <span class="math inline">\(\left[ \ldots \right]_i\)</span> we denote the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th component of the vector in the square brackets. Note that it is also possible to account for missing involvement information: If a diagnosis (like fine needle aspiration (FNA)) is only available for a subset of all LNLs, we can sum over all those possible complete observed states <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\zeta}_j\)</span> that match the provided diagnosis.</p>
<p>The single-patient likelihood <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> in <a href="#eq-single-patient-llh" class="quarto-xref">equation&nbsp;5</a> depends on the spread parameters shown in <a href="#fig-full-graph" class="quarto-xref">figure&nbsp;2</a> via the transition matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> and on the binomial parameters <span class="math inline">\(p_{\text{T}x}\)</span> via time-priors. In this work, we will only differentiate between “early” (T1 &amp; T2) and “advanced” (T3 &amp; T4) T-categories. Therefore, the parameter space of the unilateral model is:</p>
<p><span id="eq-param-space"><span class="math display">\[
\boldsymbol{\theta} = \left( \left\{ b_v \right\}, \left\{ t_{vr} \right\}, p_\text{early}, p_\text{adv.} \right) \quad \text{with} \quad \genfrac{}{}{0pt}{2}{v\leq V}{r\in\operatorname{pa}(v)}
\tag{6}\]</span></span></p>
<p>And it is our goal to infer optimal parameter values of from a given dataset <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> (consisting of diagnoses and T-categories) of OPSCC patients. The likelihood to observe this cohort of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> patients, given a set of parameters <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)</span> is simply the product of their individual likelihoods as defined in <a href="#eq-single-patient-llh" class="quarto-xref">equation&nbsp;5</a>. For numerical reasons, we typically compute the data likelihood in log space:</p>
<p><span id="eq-log-likelihood"><span class="math display">\[
\log \mathcal{L} \left( \mathcal{D} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta} \right) = \sum_{i=1}^N \log \ell_i

<h1>Extension to a Bilateral Model</h1>
<p>A straightforward approach to modeling contralateral lymphatic spread would be to use two independent unilateral models, as described in <a href="#sec-unilateral" class="quarto-xref">section&nbsp;3</a>, with shared parameters such as the distribution of diagnosis times or spread between LNLs (<span class="math inline">\(t_{vr}\)</span>). However, this method would fail to capture the correlation between ipsilateral and contralateral involvement discussed in <a href="#sec-data-strat" class="quarto-xref">section&nbsp;2.3</a>, particularly the observed increase in contralateral involvement with greater severity of ipsilateral spread.</p>
<!-- This is displayed in @tbl-data-strat and shows how often the contralateral LNLs I, II, III, and IV were involved, given all possible combinations of midline extension, T-category, and ipsilateral LNL III involvement. Unsurprisingly, the prevalence for contralateral involvement is consistently higher when the tumor extends over the mid-sagittal line or is of later T-category. But it is also more frequent when the ipsilateral side shows more severe involvement, which is here shown via the surrogate LNL III. -->
<!-- Additionally, we could think of an approach to incorporate the primary tumor's mid-sagittal extension as a risk factor. -->
<p>Thus, we extend the formalism in <a href="#sec-unilateral" class="quarto-xref">section&nbsp;3</a> in such a way that the model’s ipsi- and contralateral side evolve synchronously over time. To achieve that, we start by writing down the posterior distribution of involvement in analogy to <a href="#eq-uni-bayes-law" class="quarto-xref">equation&nbsp;15</a>, which is now a joint probability of an involvement <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}^\text{i}\)</span> ipsilaterally <em>and</em> an involvement <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}^\text{c}\)</span> contralaterally, given a diagnosis of the ipsilateral LNLs <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Z}^\text{i}\)</span> and of the contralateral ones <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Z}^\text{c}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span id="eq-bilateral-bayes"><span class="math display">\[
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \right) = \frac{P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right) P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right)}{P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \right)}
\tag{8}\]</span></span></p>
<p>For the sake of brevity, we omit the dependency on the parameters and the T-category here.</p>
<p>The probability of the diagnoses given a hidden state factorises: <span class="math inline">\(P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right) = P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i} \right) \cdot P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right)\)</span>, and the two factors are described through observation matrices <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}^\text{i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}^\text{c}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The term representing the model’s prior probability of hidden involvement does not factorize. However, we assume no direct lymphatic drainage from ipsilateral to contralateral LNLs, as major lymph vessels do not cross the mid-sagittal plane. In the graphical model, this translates to the absence of directed arcs between ipsilateral and contralateral LNLs, implying that contralateral tumor spread occurs solely via the primary tumor. We can thus write the joint probability <span class="math inline">\(P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right)\)</span> as a factorising sum:</p>
<p><span id="eq-bilateral-marginal"><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right) &amp;= \sum_{t=0}^{t_\text{max}} P(t) \cdot P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid t \right) \\
&amp;= \sum_{t=0}^{t_\text{max}} P(t) \cdot P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i} \mid t \right) \cdot P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid t \right)
\end{aligned}
\tag{9}\]</span></span></p>
<p>This assumption is intuitive: since no major lymph vessels cross the midline, the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the lymphatic network evolve independently over time. However, they are indirectly coupled through time. For example, a joint state with severe contralateral involvement and limited ipsilateral involvement is improbable: Severe contralateral involvement typically occurs at later time steps, when limited ipsilateral involvement is unlikely.</p>
<!-- There may, however, be diffusion of lymph fluid accross this line or bulky involvement that redirects lymphatic drainage significantly.-->
<p>Using <a href="#eq-bilateral-marginal" class="quarto-xref">equation&nbsp;9</a> along with <a href="#eq-lambda-matrix" class="quarto-xref">equation&nbsp;4</a>, we can write the above distribution algebraically as a product:</p>
<p><span id="eq-bilateral-marginal-algebra"><span class="math display">\[
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_n, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_m \right) = \left[ \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^\intercal_\text{i} \cdot \operatorname{diag} P(\mathbf{t}) \cdot \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_\text{c} \right]_{n,m}
\tag{10}\]</span></span></p>
<section id="sec-params-symmetry" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-params-symmetry">Parameter Symmetries</h2>
<p>The matrices <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\text{i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\text{c}\)</span> could, in principle, be parameterized with entirely separate parameters, allowing ipsilateral and contralateral spread rates to differ completely. However, we simplify the parameter space by sharing parameters between the two sides, based on the following three assumptions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Shared Graph Structure</strong>: Both ipsilateral and contralateral spread are described by the same graph shown in <a href="#fig-full-graph" class="quarto-xref">figure&nbsp;2</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Symmetric Spread Among LNLs</strong>: The spread among LNLs is assumed to be the same on both sides, reflecting the symmetric structure of the lymphatic system. Consequently, the spread rates between nodes should also be symmetric. This is formalized as:<br>
<span id="eq-symmetries"><span class="math display">\[
  \begin{aligned}
  b_v^\text{c} &amp;\neq b_v^\text{i} \\
  t_{rv}^\text{c} &amp;= t_{rv}^\text{i}
  \end{aligned}
   \tag{11}\]</span></span> for all <span class="math inline">\(v \leq V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r \in \operatorname{pa}(v)\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Asymmetric Spread from Tumor</strong>: Tumor spread to the contralateral side varies depending on whether the tumor crosses the mid-sagittal plane. When the tumor extends over the midline, its spread rate to the contralateral LNLs should be larger than if the tumor were lateralized, but still smaller than the tumor’s spread to the ipsilateral side. To model this, we introduce a mixing parameter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in [0,1]\)</span>, representing the “degree of asymmetry” effectively mixing these two extremes:<br>
<span id="eq-mixing"><span class="math display">\[
  b_v^{\text{c},\epsilon=\texttt{True}} = \alpha \cdot b_v^\text{i} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot b_v^{\text{c},\epsilon=\texttt{False}}
   \tag{12}\]</span></span> This parameterization results in three sets of rates for tumor spread to the LNLs: (1) the spread to ipsilateral LNLs <span class="math inline">\(b^\text{i}_v\)</span>, (2) the spread to contralateral LNLs as long as the tumor is lateralized <span class="math inline">\(b_v^{\text{c},\epsilon=\texttt{False}}\)</span>, (3) the spread to contralateral LNLs when the tumor crosses the midline <span class="math inline">\(b_v^{\text{c},\epsilon=\texttt{True}}\)</span>. Despite this additional complexity, these rates collectively account for only <span class="math inline">\(2 \cdot 2^V + 1\)</span> parameters due to their coupling via <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The parameter space now becomes:</p>
<p><span id="eq-bi-param-space"><span class="math display">\[
\boldsymbol{\theta} = \left( \left\{ b_v^\text{i} \right\}, \left\{ b_v^\text{c} \right\}, \alpha, \left\{ t_{vr} \right\}, p_\text{early}, p_\text{adv.} \right) \quad \text{with} \quad \genfrac{}{}{0pt}{2}{v\leq V}{r\in\operatorname{pa}(v)}
\tag{13}\]</span></span></p>
<p>This results in less than a doubling of parameters compared to the unilateral model. From these parameters, we construct three transition matrices: the unchanged <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}_\text{i}\)</span> for the ipsilateral side, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{False}}\)</span> for contralateral progression while the tumor is lateralized, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{True}}\)</span> for cases where the tumor crosses the mid-sagittal plane.</p>
</section>
<section id="sec-midline" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-midline">Modelling Midline Extension</h2>
<p>Most tumors crossing the midline at the time of diagnosis likely began as lateralized tumors that grew over the midline at a later stage. As a result, the transition matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{True}}\)</span> applies only to a subset of time-steps.</p>
<p>To account for this, we model the tumor’s extension over the mid-sagittal line as a binary random variable. A tumor starts as lateralized, with a finite probability <span class="math inline">\(p_\epsilon\)</span> at each time step of crossing the midline. The overall probabilities of a patient having a clearly lateralized tumor or one extending over the mid-sagittal line after <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> time steps are then given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
P(\epsilon = \texttt{False} \mid t) &amp;= (1 - p_\epsilon)^t \\
P(\epsilon = \texttt{True} \mid t) &amp;= 1 - P(\epsilon = \texttt{False} \mid t)
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Using this, it is straightforward to write down the matrix of state distributions for all time-steps, as in <a href="#eq-lambda-matrix" class="quarto-xref">equation&nbsp;4</a> covering the contralateral hidden state evolution:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{False}} =
\left(
\begin{array}{r}
\boldsymbol{\pi}^\intercal \cdot \left( \mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{False}} \right)^{0\phantom{t_\text{max}}} \\
(1-p_\epsilon) \cdot \boldsymbol{\pi}^\intercal \cdot \left( \mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{False}} \right)^{1\phantom{t_\text{max}}} \\
\hfill \vdots \hfill \\
(1-p_\epsilon)^{t_\text{max}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\pi}^\intercal \cdot \left( \mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{False}} \right)^{t_\text{max}\phantom{0}} \\
\end{array}
\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>where we used the transition matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{False}}\)</span> that depends on the base spread parameters <span class="math inline">\(b_v^{\text{c},\epsilon=\texttt{False}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The case of midline extension is more complex: we already marginalize over the exact time step when the tumor grows over the mid-sagittal line. However, at the point of crossing, the contralateral transition matrix must switch to the increased spread rates, <span class="math inline">\(b_v^{\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True}}\)</span>, as defined by the linear mixing in <a href="#eq-mixing" class="quarto-xref">equation&nbsp;12</a>. To correctly perform this marginalization, we iteratively construct the joint distribution <span class="math inline">\(P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \mid t \right)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We begin at <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>, where all contralateral LNLs are healthy (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}_\text{c}=\boldsymbol{\xi}_0\)</span>) and the tumor is lateralized (<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon=\texttt{False}\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_0, \epsilon=\texttt{False} \mid t=0 \right) = 1
\]</span></p>
<p>while all other states have zero probability.</p>
<p>At some later time step <span class="math inline">\(t=\tau+1\)</span>, there are two scenarios to marginalize over:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The tumor was lateralized at <span class="math inline">\(t=\tau\)</span> and grew over the midline at <span class="math inline">\(t=\tau+1\)</span>:</strong><br>
In this case, the probability of midline extension at <span class="math inline">\(t=\tau+1\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(p_\epsilon\)</span>. This probability weights the contralateral state distribution that had previously evolved without increased contralateral spread.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The tumor had already crossed the midline before <span class="math inline">\(t=\tau\)</span>:</strong><br>
Here, the tumor remains in the midline-crossed state with probability 1. To account for this scenario, we simply include the distribution <span class="math inline">\(P\left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \mid \tau \right)\)</span> from the previous time step.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Combining these scenarios leads to a recursive formulation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \mid \tau + 1 \right) = \big[ p_\epsilon P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{False} \mid \tau \right) + P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \mid \tau \right) \big]^\top \cdot \mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{True}}
\]</span></p>
<p>We can collect the iteratively computed distributions for the midline extension case to define the matrix over the states given all time-steps, in analogy to <a href="#eq-lambda-matrix" class="quarto-xref">equation&nbsp;4</a>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{True}} = \begin{pmatrix}
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \mid 0 \right) \\
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \mid 1 \right) \\
\vdots \\
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \mid t_\text{max} \right) \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>Using this, we can again write the joint of ipsi- and contralateral involvement - now also for the case of mid-sagittal extension - algebraically as before in <a href="#eq-bilateral-marginal-algebra" class="quarto-xref">equation&nbsp;10</a>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_n, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_m, \epsilon \right) = \left[ \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^\intercal_\text{i} \cdot \operatorname{diag} P(\mathbf{t}) \cdot \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_\text{c}^\epsilon \right]_{n,m}
\]</span></p>
<p>With the above, we compute the likelihood of all patients with and without midline extension separately. And if for some patients the information of tumor lateralization is not available, we can simply marginalize over the unknown variable <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon \in \{ \texttt{False}, \texttt{True} \}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The final parameter space of our extended model has now reached this size:</p>
<p><span id="eq-ext-param-space"><span class="math display">\[
\boldsymbol{\theta} = \left( \left\{ b_v^\text{i} \right\}, \left\{ b_v^\text{c} \right\}, \alpha, \left\{ t_{vr} \right\}, p_\text{early}, p_\text{adv.}, p_\epsilon \right) \quad \text{with} \quad \genfrac{}{}{0pt}{2}{v\leq V}{r\in\operatorname{pa}(v)}

<p>Our stated goal is to compute the risk for a patient’s true ipsi- and contralateral nodal involvement states <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}^\text{i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}^\text{c}\)</span>, <em>given</em> their individual diagnosis <span class="math inline">\(d = \left( \boldsymbol{\zeta}^\text{i}_k, \boldsymbol{\zeta}^\text{c}_\ell, \epsilon, \text{T}x \right)\)</span>. Here, this diagnosis consists of the observed ipsi- and contralateral nodal involvements, the patient’s midline extension <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, and their tumor’s T-category <span class="math inline">\(\text{T}x\)</span>. Using Bayes’ law, we can write this risk as:</p>
<p><span id="eq-uni-bayes-law"><span class="math display">\[
P \big( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid d, \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}} \big)

The <em>prior</em> <span class="math inline">\(P \big( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \mid \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}, \text{T}x \big)\)</span> in the above equation is the crucial term that is supplied by a trained model and its parameters <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is possible to compute this <em>posterior</em> probability of true involvement not only for one fully defined state <span class="math inline">\((\mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c})\)</span>, but also for e.g.&nbsp;individual LNLs: For example, the risk for involvement in the contralateral level IV would be a marginalization over all ipsilateral states <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\xi}^\text{i}_i\)</span> and all contralateral states <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\xi}^\text{c}_j\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\xi^\text{c}_{j4}=1\)</span>.

<p>Rather than providing the model with a patient’s diagnoses from multiple modalities with different sensitivities and specificities (e.g.&nbsp;PET-CT <em>and</em> MRI), we combined them into a single “consensus” diagnosis before inference. This approach was necessary because literature-reported diagnostic imaging sensitivities and specificities did not plausibly match our observations. For instance, in the USZ cohort, 78% of OPSCC patients were diagnosed with ipsilateral LNL II involvement -— a finding difficult to reconcile with typical imaging sensitivities around 80% and specificities below 100% <span class="citation" data-cites="debondt_detection_2007 kyzas_18ffluorodeoxyglucose_2008">(<a href="#ref-debondt_detection_2007" role="doc-biblioref">De Bondt et al. 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-kyzas_18ffluorodeoxyglucose_2008" role="doc-biblioref">Kyzas et al. 2008</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>We initialized 12 parallel samplers (“walkers”) with random values from the unit cube, effectively representing a uniform prior distribution over the model parameters. Convergence was determined by two criteria:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The change in autocorrelation time was less than 5.0e-2.</li>
<li>The autocorrelation estimate dropped below <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> / 50, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the chain length. Earlier autocorrelation estimates might not be trustworthy.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-prevalence">Computing the Observed and Predicted Prevalence of Involvement Patterns</h2>
<p>We evaluate the model’s ability to approximate the observed distribution of lymphatic involvement patterns. We compare the prevalence of selected involvement patterns in the data to the model’s predicted prevalence, given patient scenarios.</p>
<p>A “scenario” includes the patient’s T-category <span class="math inline">\(\text{T}x\)</span> and whether the tumor extended over the mid-sagittal line, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon=\texttt{True}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon=\texttt{False}\)</span>. An involvement pattern specifies all ipsi- and contralateral LNLs’ status as “healthy”, “involved”, or “masked” (ignored).</p>
<p>For example, we may assess contralateral LNL II involvement prevalence under early T-category (T0-T2) and no midline extension (<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon=\texttt{False}\)</span>). In the data, 379 such patients were observed, with 27 exhibiting contralateral LNL II involvement – a prevalence of 7.12%.</p>
<p>To visualize the data prevalence, we plot a <em>beta posterior</em> over the true prevalence <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. It is the result of a uniform beta prior over <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, multiplied with the binomial likelihood for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> out of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> patients, given <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. The resulting distribution has its maximum at <span class="math inline">\(q=k / n\)</span> and nicely captures the uncertainty in the observed cohort: if only 3 out of 10 patients are observed with a specific pattern, the distribution is much wider than if we observe 300 out of 1000.</p>
<p>The model’s predicted prevalence to compare it with is computed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P \left( \text{II}^\text{c} \mid \epsilon=\texttt{False}, \text{T}x=\text{early} \right) = \frac{P \left( \text{II}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{False} \mid \text{T}x=\text{early} \right)}{P \left( \epsilon=\texttt{False} \mid \text{T}x=\text{early} \right)}
\]</span></p>
<p>In the enumator, we marginalize over all ipsi- and contralateral LNLs’ involvements, except for LNL II contralaterally. This is similar to the marginalization in <a href="#eq-marg-over-posterior" class="quarto-xref">equation&nbsp;16</a>, although we are summing over different quantities. In the denominator, we can simply insert the joint distribution over midline extension and diagnose time <span class="math inline">\(P \left( \epsilon, t \right)\)</span> marginalized over <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> using the early T-category’s time-prior.</p>
<p>We display model predictions as histograms, each value computed from one of the MCMC samples. Ideally, these approximate the location and width of the beta posteriors from the data showing an accurate and precise fit.</p>
<p>Note that we omit the y-axis in these figures, as their numerical value is not intuitively interpretable. We instead use the free space to label e.g.&nbsp;rows in an array of subplots.</p>

<h1>Results: Model evaluation</h1>
<p>In <a href="#tbl-midline-params" class="quarto-xref">table&nbsp;2</a>, we tabulate the mean and standard deviation of the sampled parameters.

Any discrepancies may be due to differences in the patient cohorts. Therefore, we omit the analysis of the ipsilateral spread patterns and focus instead on the analysis of contralateral involvement. Lastly, note the relatively small contralateral spread parameters <span class="math inline">\(b^c_v\)</span> compared to the ipsilateral parameters <span class="math inline">\(b^i_v\)</span>. This accurately reflects the low prevalence of contralateral lymph node involvement for lateralized tumors.</p>

<p>For clinical applications, the model needs to estimate the risk of occult metastases in clinically negative LNLs based on a patient’s diagnosis.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contralateral-lnl-ii">Contralateral LNL II</h2>
<p>The predicted risk of occult disease in contralateral LNL II is shown in the left panel of <a href="#fig-model-risks" class="quarto-xref">figure&nbsp;10</a>. Tumor lateralization is the strongest determinant of risk. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A patient with a lateralized early T-category tumor and ipsilateral LNL II involvement has a predicted risk of 1.55% for occult contralateral LNL II disease (green histogram).<br>
</li>
<li>If the same tumor extends over the midline, the risk increases to 7.58% (orange histogram).</li>
</ul>
<p>Advanced T-category further increases risk but has less impact than midline extension. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>An early T-category tumor crossing the midline with ipsilateral involvement of LNLs II and III has a 9.06% risk of contralateral LNL II disease (red histogram).<br>
</li>
<li>For the same scenario with an advanced T-category tumor, the risk rises to 11.25% (purple histogram).</li>
</ul>
<p>The degree of ipsilateral involvement also influences risk. For a midline-extending early T-category tumor, a clinically N0 ipsilateral neck predicts a risk of 7.58%, compared to 9.06% when LNLs II and III are involved.</p>
<p>In summary, midline extension is the primary risk factor for contralateral LNL II involvement, but advanced T-category and extensive ipsilateral involvement also contribute significantly.</p>

<p>As shown in the center panel of <a href="#fig-model-risks" class="quarto-xref">figure&nbsp;10</a>, the risk of occult contralateral LNL III involvement rarely exceeds 5% and depends strongly on upstream LNL II involvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>For an advanced T-category tumor extending over the midline and with extensive clinical involvement in the ipsilateral LNLs II, III, and IV, but a clinically negative contralateral neck, the risk is only 2.07% (green histogram).<br>
</li>
<li>If contralateral LNL II is clinically involved, the risk for contralateral LNL III rises to 4.77% (blue histogram).<br>
</li>
<li>When contralateral LNL II involvement is confirmed by FNA, the risk further increases to 6.94% (red histogram).</li>
</ul>
<p>Even for lateralized tumors, FNA-confirmed involvement in contralateral LNL II predicts a 5.58% risk for LNL III involvement (orange histogram). This highlights the importance of upstream LNL II involvement in determining the risk for LNL III.</p>

<ul>
<li>If contralateral LNL III is also clinically involved, the risk increases to 2.81% (blue histogram).<br>
</li>
<li>When contralateral LNL III involvement is confirmed by FNA, the risk rises significantly to 5.68% (orange histogram).</li>
</ul>
<p>This higher risk occurs because FNA confirmation eliminates the possibility of false-positive diagnoses for contralateral LNL III, strongly increasing the likelihood of downstream LNL IV involvement.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This work introduces a formalism to model ipsi- and contralateral lymph node involvement in oropharyngeal SCC patients.

Our extension is both intuitive and interpretable, with parameters learned from a dataset of 833 patients across four institutions. The model uses clinically diagnosed LNL involvement, tumor T-category, and lateralization to provide personalized risk predictions for occult disease in any LNL of interest.</p>
<p>Despite its relatively few parameters, the model is highly interpretable, with each parameter having a clear, intuitive explanation. At the same time, it effectively describes the observed data on ipsilateral and contralateral nodal involvement. To our knowledge, this represents the most comprehensive model of lymphatic tumor progression in oropharyngeal SCC, surpassing prior efforts, which were conceptually different, limited in scope, or not trained on real patient data <span class="citation" data-cites="benson_markov_2006 jung_development_2017">(<a href="#ref-benson_markov_2006" role="doc-biblioref">Benson, Whipple, and Kalet 2006</a>; <a href="#ref-jung_development_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Jung et al. 2017</a>)</span>.

Based on a 5% acceptable risk threshold for occult disease in any LNL, the model recommends the following approach for contralateral elective irradiation, assuming the respective LNL is clinically healthy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lateralized tumors with no contralateral clinical involvement:</strong><br>
Unilateral radiotherapy is sufficient, regardless of T-category or ipsilateral involvement.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Tumors extending over the midline with no contralateral clinical involvement:</strong><br>
Elective irradiation is limited to LNL II.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Contralateral LNL III:</strong><br>
Irradiate only if LNL II is involved, regardless of tumor lateralization, T-category, or ipsilateral involvement. If contralateral LNL II is clinically negative, LNL III is not irradiated unless LNL IV is involved.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Contralateral LNL IV:</strong><br>
Irradiate only when LNL III involvement is confirmed.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Contralateral LNL V:</strong><br>
Elective irradiation is generally unnecessary. Only in extreme cases, such as advanced T-category tumors with midline extension and confirmed contralateral involvement in LNLs II to IV, is irradiation of LNL V considered.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Contralateral LNLs I and VII:</strong><br>
Elective irradiation is not recommended unless these nodes are clinically involved.</li>

While this approach captures the overall differences between early and advanced T-category tumors well (as seen in <a href="#fig-model-prevalences-overall" class="quarto-xref">figure&nbsp;7</a>), it is not perfect.</p>
<p>For example: - The observed differences between early and advanced T-category tumors may sometimes be greater or smaller than the model’s predictions. This has been previously noted for ipsilateral LNL I involvement <span class="citation" data-cites="ludwig_modelling_2023">(<a href="#ref-ludwig_modelling_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Ludwig et al. 2023</a>)</span>. - For contralateral spread, the prevalence of midline extension is slightly overestimated for early T-category tumors and underestimated for advanced T-category tumors, as discussed in <a href="#sec-prevalence-midext" class="quarto-xref">section&nbsp;12</a>.</p>

<section id="sensitivity-and-specificity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sensitivity-and-specificity">Sensitivity and Specificity</h3>
<p>As noted in <a href="#sec-methods-consensus" class="quarto-xref">section&nbsp;5.1</a> and further detailed in <a href="#sec-consensus" class="quarto-xref">section&nbsp;10</a>, we assumed that the consensus across diagnostic modalities reflects the true state <span class="math inline">\(X_v\)</span> of lymph node involvement. While this assumption is reasonable for pathologically confirmed diagnoses, it is an approximation for clinically diagnosed involvement, which cannot detect occult disease by definition.</p>
<p>The model could, in principle, distinguish between pathologically confirmed and clinically diagnosed involvement by incorporating different sensitivity and specificity values for each diagnostic modality. However, this was not implemented in the current work for two reasons: 1. <strong>Simplified evaluation:</strong> This approximation allowed for direct comparison between the observed prevalence of involvement and the model’s predictions, enabling an evaluation of the model’s ability to describe the data with few interpretable parameters. 2. <strong>Inconsistent literature values:</strong> Reported sensitivity and specificity values for diagnostic modalities show inconsistencies with some observed data patterns, complicating their integration into the model.</p>
<p>Future efforts could focus on developing methods to rigorously differentiate between pathologically confirmed and clinically diagnosed involvement, potentially improving model accuracy for clinical settings.</p>

<section id="tumor-subsites" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tumor-subsites">Tumor Subsites</h3>
<p>Oropharyngeal tumors occur in distinct subsites, such as the base of the tongue or the tonsils, which may exhibit slightly different lymphatic metastatic patterns. Incorporating subsite-specific information into the model could enhance its predictive accuracy. Preliminary investigations suggest that a mixture model may effectively capture these subsite-specific spread patterns <span class="citation" data-cites="sarrut_proceedings_2024 ludwig_modelling_2023a">(<a href="#ref-sarrut_proceedings_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Sarrut and Rit 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-ludwig_modelling_2023a" role="doc-biblioref">Ludwig 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This approach could also facilitate extending the model to other tumor locations, such as the oral cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx. Including these additional tumor sites would broaden the model’s applicability and improve its clinical utility for head and neck cancer patients.</p>

</div></section><section id="sec-consensus" class="level1 appendix"><h2 class="anchored quarto-appendix-heading">Consensus on most likely involvement</h2><div class="quarto-appendix-contents">

<p>The consensus on the most likely involvement state of a LNL was formed as follows: Suppose the involvement status <span class="math inline">\(X_v\)</span> of LNL <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> was assessed using different diagnostic modalities <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O} = \{ \text{MRI}, \text{CT}, \text{pathology}, \ldots \}\)</span>, each characterized by their own pair of sensitivity and specificity values <span class="math inline">\(s_N^{\mathcal{o}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_P^{\mathcal{o}}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{o} \in \mathcal{O}\)</span>. These values are tabulated in <a href="#tbl-spec-sens" class="quarto-xref">table&nbsp;3</a>. Then we have <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{O}|\)</span> observations <span class="math inline">\(z_v^{\mathcal{o}} \in \left[ 0, 1 \right]\)</span>, where 0 stands for “healthy” and 1 for “involved”. We can then compute the most likely true involvement <span class="math inline">\(X_v\)</span> using the likelihood function</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\ell \left( X_v \mid \{ z_v^{\mathcal{o}} \}_{\mathcal{o} \in \mathcal{O}} \right) = \prod_{\mathcal{o} \in \mathcal{O}}
\left( 1 - X_v \right) \cdot &amp;\left[ z_v^{\mathcal{o}} \cdot \left( 1 - s_P^{\mathcal{o}} \right) + \left( 1 - z_v^{\mathcal{o}} \right) \cdot s_P^{\mathcal{o}} \right] \\
+ X_v \cdot &amp;\left[ z_v^{\mathcal{o}} \cdot s_N^{\mathcal{o}} + \left( 1 - z_v^{\mathcal{o}} \right) \cdot (1 - s_N^{\mathcal{o}}) \right]
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>We now assume the true state <span class="math inline">\(X_v\)</span> to take on the value 1 if <span class="math inline">\(\ell \left( X_v = 1 \mid \ldots \right) &gt; \ell \left( X_v = 0 \mid \ldots \right)\)</span> and 0 otherwise. For example, if we have <span class="math inline">\(z_\text{II}^\text{CT} = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_\text{II}^\text{MRI} = 1\)</span> we would compute the following likelihoods:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\ell \left( X_\text{II} = 1 \mid z_\text{II}^\text{CT} = 0, z_\text{II}^\text{MRI} = 1 \right) &amp;= \left( 1 - s_N^\text{CT} \right) \cdot s_N^\text{MRI} = 15.39\% \\
\ell \left( X_\text{II} = 0 \mid z_\text{II}^\text{CT} = 0, z_\text{II}^\text{MRI} = 1 \right) &amp;= s_P^\text{CT} \cdot \left(1 - s_N^\text{MRI}\right) = 14.44\%
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>In this example, we would thus assume the true state to be involved (<span class="math inline">\(X_\text{II} = 1\)</span>).</p>
<p>This method of computing a consensus also ensures that the pathology reports always override any conflicting clinical diagnosis, due to pathology’s high sensitivity and specificity.</p>

<p>In <a href="#fig-model-prevalences-midext" class="quarto-xref">figure&nbsp;11</a>, we plot the prevalence of midline extension in the data versus our model’s prediction. It is obvious the model cannot match the large spread between early and advanced T-category seen in the data. This is because to achieve that, it would need to increase the advanced T-category patient’s prior distribution over diagnosis times and at the same time reduce the probability of the tumor to cross the midline during a time-step. But since the time-priors parameter is also coupled with the spread probabilities among the LNLs, the model does not have that freedom.</p>
<!-- Should the paragraphs below be part of the discussion? -->
<p>However, we do not consider this discrepancy a major limitation of the model: We will not realistically be interested in the probability of midline extension, as it is always possible to assess it with high certainty. That is also the reason why we initially modelled the midline extension <em>not</em> as a random variable, but as a global risk factor that would have been turned on or off from the onset of a patient’s disease evolution. This, however, lead to overly high risks for contralateral involvement in advanced T-category patients with midline extension, because then the model assumes an increased spread to the contralateral side from the onset of the disease. Which is probably not true in a majority of those cases. Thus, treating it as a random variable that only becomes true during a patient’s disease evolution resulted in a better description of the data.</p>
<p>Formally, the wrong prediction of midline extension prevalence makes little difference, since it is always given: Instead of <span class="math inline">\(P\left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \mid \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \right)\)</span>, we typically compute <span class="math inline">\(P\left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right)\)</span>, which does not suffer from the wrong probability of midline extension, as the distribution over hidden states is renormalized:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right) = \frac{P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right) P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right)}{P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right)}
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that a distribution over <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> appears both in the enumerator and the denominator, which largely cancel each other, leaving only the midline extension’s effect on the distribution over hidden states in the prediction.</p>
<p>Also, the discrepancy in midline extension prevalence between early and advanced T-category is particularly pronounced in oropharyngeal SCC patients. For example, in oral cavity SCC, the midline extension only increases from 15.4% (20 out of 130) to 33.3% (13 out of 39).</p>
