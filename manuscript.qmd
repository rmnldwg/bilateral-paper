title: "Probabilistic Model of Bilateral Lymphatic Spread in Head and Neck Cancer"
abstract: |
  Purpose: According to current guidelines for elective nodal irradiation of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients, large parts of the contralateral lymphatic system are included in the elective clinical target volume (CTV-N), even for lateralized tumors without clinical lymph node involvement in the contralateral neck. In this work, we present a probabilistic model for bilateral lymphatic tumor progression in OPSCC to predict the personal risk for occult disease in any lymph node level (LNL), given the patient's clinical lymph node involvement, T-stage, and lateralization of the primary tumor.

  Methods: We extend a hidden markov model for lymphatic tumor progression, which was previously developed for ipsilateral lymph node involvement, to the contralateral neck. The model represents each of the LNLs I, II, III, IV, V, and VII of both sides of the neck as a hidden binary random variable with states healthy and involved. LNLs are connected to the tumor and among each other via arcs that correspond to spread probabilities. These spread probability rates are learned via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from a dataset of 833 OPSCC patients.

  Results: The model is able to describe the data on lymph node involvement well with a small number of interpretable parameters. Midline extension of the primary tumor is the main risk factor for contralateral involvement. In addition, the risk of occult metastases in contralateral lymph node level increases with more advanced T-stage and more severe ipsilateral involvement. The probability of involvement in contralateral level III is very low if the upstream level II is clinically negative. Similarly, the probability of involvement in contralateral level IV is very low if the upstream level III is clinically negative.

  Conclusions: The model may guide personalized volume reduction of the elective CTV-N. It suggests that the contralateral neck may be spared from elective irradiation for lateralized tumors not crossing the midline. In patients with primary tumors crossing the midline but clinically negative contralateral neck, the contralateral elective irradiation may be limited to level II.

# Introduction

In treating head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with radiotherapy or surgery, both the primary tumor and clinically detected lymph node metastases are targeted. Current guidelines also include large portions of the neck in the elective clinical target volume (CTV-N) [@gregoire_ctbased_2003;@gregoire_delineation_2014;@gregoire_delineation_2018;@eisbruch_intensitymodulated_2002;@biau_selection_2019;@chao_determination_2002;@vorwerk_guidelines_2011;@ferlito_elective_2009] to mitigate the risk of regional recurrences from untreated microscopic disease undetectable by in-vivo imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET). However, this approach must balance minimizing the risk of occult disease in the lymphatic drainage region against the toxicity of unnecessarily irradiating healthy tissue.

These CTV-N guidelines rely on anatomically defined lymph node levels (LNLs) [@gregoire_delineation_2014] and the overall prevalence of lymph node metastases within these levels. They often recommend extensive irradiation of both sides of the neck. However, the general prevalence of metastasis in a given LNL does not correspond to an individual patient's risk of occult disease in that region, which depends on their specific state of tumor progression. For example, a patient with no clinically detectable nodal disease (cN0) who has a small, clearly lateralized T1 tumor would receive the same contralateral CTV-N as a patient with significant ipsilateral nodal involvement and an advanced tumor crossing the mid-sagittal plane: Both patients receive elective irradiation of the contralateral LNLs II, III, and IVa [@biau_selection_2019].

To better quantify individualized risk of occult disease, we previously developed an intuitive probabilistic hidden Markov model (HMM) [@ludwig_hidden_2021;@ludwig_modelling_2023], originally based on a conceptually similar a Bayesian network model [@pouymayou_bayesian_2019]. However, these models have been limited to predicting ipsilateral nodal involvement. This work extends the model to include contralateral risk predictions, enabling more personalized radiation volume recommendations. By identifying patients with low contralateral risk, the model could guide reductions in contralateral CTV-N, thereby decreasing radiation-induced toxicity and improving quality of life.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

1. Section @sec-data presents a multi-centric dataset on lymph node involvement in {{< var data.num_patients >}} OPSCC patients, identifying key risk factors for contralateral lymph node involvement and outlining requirements for a bilateral model extension (@sec-requirements).

2. Section @sec-ext-to-contra introduces a bilateral HMM that incorporates primary tumor lateralization, T-category, and clinical involvement as risk factors for contralateral involvement. Model training and computational experiments are described in @sec-methods.

3. Section @sec-results demonstrates the model's ability to replicate observed contralateral lymph node involvement patterns and estimates occult disease risk for typical patients. Implications for volume-deescalated radiotherapy are discussed in @sec-discussion.


# Data on Lymphatic Progression Patterns {#sec-data}

To develop models for lymphatic tumor progression for all relevant LNLs, including contralateral regions, we compiled a detailed dataset of {{< var data.num_patients >}} patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) [@ludwig_dataset_2022;@ludwig_multicentric_2024]. The dataset includes lymph node involvement per LNL for each patient in tabular form, along with primary tumor and patient characteristics such as T-category, subsite, primary tumor lateralization, and HPV p16 status. Patient records were collected from four institutions, and an overview of patient characteristics is provided in @tbl-data-overview.

Data from Inselspital Bern (ISB) and Centre Léon Bérard (CLB) consist exclusively of patients who underwent neck dissections. In contrast, the majority of patients from the University Hospital Zürich (USZ) and the Hospital Vall d'Hebron (HVH) were treated with definitive radiotherapy. Since surgical treatment is more common for early T-category patients, ISB and CLB datasets include a higher proportion of these cases compared to USZ and HVH. For 83 patients in the CLB dataset, the primary tumor's lateralization was not reported.

## Consensus on Involvement Status {#sec-data-consensus}

Pathological involvement is available only for surgically treated patients and for the levels that were dissected. For non-surgical patients, involvement status is determined clinically, i.e. using imaging. To ensure uniformity in analysis, diagnostic information was synthesized into a consensus decision for each patient and LNL. This consensus reflects the most likely state of involvement and accounts for the sensitivity and specificity of various diagnostic modalities, as reported in the literature [@debondt_detection_2007;@kyzas_18ffluorodeoxyglucose_2008].

The consensus process is detailed in @sec-consensus. Briefly, pathological findings from neck dissections are treated as the gold standard, overriding any conflicting clinical diagnoses. For levels not dissected, PET-CT is typically the primary source for determining the most likely state of involvement.


## Data Availability

The complete dataset, including additional patients with tumors in primary sites other than the oropharynx, is publicly accessible. It can be [downloaded from LyProX](https://lyprox.org/patients/dataset), where it is also available for interactive exploration, [from GitHub](https://github.com/rmnldwg/lydata), or [from Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/search?q=lydata). Additional details about the datasets and data format are provided in designated Data-in-Brief publications [@ludwig_dataset_2022;@ludwig_multicentric_2024]. These publications do not include the latest data from HVH, which will be described in a future publication.


## Patterns of Contralateral Involvement {#sec-data-strat}

The datasets enable analysis of correlations between LNL involvement and key risk factors. In @fig-data-strat, we illustrate the prevalence of contralateral LNL involvement, stratified by T-category, the number of ipsilaterally involved LNLs, and whether the tumor extends across the mid-sagittal plane.

![Contralateral involvement stratified by T-category (top left panel), the number of metastatic LNLs ipsilaterally (top right panel), and whether the primary tumor extended over the mid-sagittal line or was clearly lateralized (bottom left panel). Additionally, in the bottom right, we show that even for lateralized tumors, T-category and ipsilateral involvement are correlated with contralateral metastasis by comparing the contralateral involvement prevalence for selected scenarios that vary in their T-category and ipsilateral involvement extent.](figures/fig_data_strat.svg){#fig-data-strat}

### Midline Extension

The bottom left panel of @fig-data-strat shows that tumors crossing the mid-sagittal plane have a substantially higher prevalence of contralateral involvement compared to clearly lateralized tumors. This aligns with the anatomy of the head and neck lymphatic system, which is symmetric, with no major lymph vessels crossing the midline. Interstitial fluids from the primary tumor, presumed to carry malignant cells, can merely diffuse to contralateral lymphatic vessels over short distances. Thus, contralateral spread is more likely when the tumor approaches or crosses the midline. <!-- citation(s) needed? or is this intuition good enough? -->

### T-Category

The top left panel shows a correlation between T-category and contralateral involvement, reflecting T-category's role as a surrogate for the time elapsed between disease onset and diagnosis. Advanced T-category tumors (e.g., T4) generally represent a longer disease progression timeline, providing more opportunity for metastatic spread compared to smaller tumors (e.g., T1).

### Ipsilateral Involvement

The top right panel reveals a positive correlation between ipsilateral and contralateral metastases. Extensive ipsilateral involvement likely indicates a longer or faster disease progression. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that bulky ipsilateral nodal disease may reroute lymphatic drainage toward the contralateral side, potentially facilitating contralateral metastasis. <!-- citation needed? -->

### Interplay of Risk Factors

Midline extension, T-category, and ipsilateral involvement are interrelated risk factors for contralateral metastasis. For instance, {{< var data.late_with_midext_percent >}}% of advanced T-category tumors exhibit midline extension compared to {{< var data.early_with_midext_percent >}}% of early T-category tumors. While the higher fraction of midline extensions in advanced T-category patients partially accounts for the higher contralateral metastasis rates, T-category itself and ipsilateral involvement also play an additional role.

The bottom right panel of @fig-data-strat isolates patients with lateralized tumors that do not cross the midline, further demonstrating these relationships. Among early T-category patients with no ipsilateral nodal involvement (levels I-V), only {{< var data.early_ipsin0_cII_percent >}}% ({{< var data.early_ipsin0_cII_match >}} of {{< var data.early_ipsin0_cII_total >}} patients) show involvement in contralateral level II. This proportion increases to {{< var data.early_ipsiII_cII_percent >}}% ({{< var data.early_ipsiII_cII_match >}} of {{< var data.early_ipsiII_cII_total >}}) if ipsilateral level II is involved, to {{< var data.early_ipsiIIandIII_cII_percent >}}% ({{< var data.early_ipsiIIandIII_cII_match >}} of {{< var data.early_ipsiIIandIII_cII_total >}}) if ipsilateral levels II and III are involved, and further to {{< var data.late_ipsiIIandIII_cII_percent >}}% ({{< var data.late_ipsiIIandIII_cII_match >}} of {{< var data.late_ipsiIIandIII_cII_total >}}) for advanced T-category tumors with ipsilateral levels II and III involved.


## Requirements for a Bilateral Model {#sec-requirements}

Based on the observations in @sec-data-strat above, any model predicting the risk of contralateral nodal involvement should account for the following:

1. **Midline Extension:** Tumors extending across the mid-sagittal plane should result in a significantly higher probability of contralateral metastases.
2. **T-Category and Disease Progression:** Advanced T-category should correspond to an increased risk of nodal disease. This can be modeled using the expected time of diagnosis, as demonstrated in a prior hidden Markov model [@ludwig_hidden_2021].
3. **Ipsilateral Involvement as a Progression Marker:** The extent of ipsilateral involvement should provide additional information on the time elapsed between disease onset and diagnosis, supplementing the insights gained from T-category alone.

<!-- Over the course of this work, we will first briefly recap the HMM in @sec-unilateral, which was so far used to model ipsilateral lymphatic progression only. Then, we intuitively extend it to include the contralateral side as well in @sec-ext-to-contra. In this section, we also introduce a way of modelling the tumor's midline extension as a random variable (@sec-midline) and lastly talk about how it may affect the contralateral spread in @sec-params-symmetry. -->

<!-- TODO: Hint at methods and results... -->


# Unilateral Model for Lymphatic Progression {#sec-unilateral}

This paper builds on the previously developed unilateral model for ipsilateral lymph node involvement presented in [@ludwig_modelling_2024]. Below, we briefly recap the unilateral model to introduce the notation required for extending the framework to a bilateral model, described in @sec-ext-to-contra. For further details on the ipsilateral model, refer to earlier publications [@ludwig_hidden_2021; @ludwig_modelling_2024].

<!--
Our first model to predict the lymphatic progression of HNSCC was introduced using Bayesian networks [@pouymayou_bayesian_2019]. We subsequently extended this work to a hidden Markov model (HMM) [@ludwig_hidden_2021] to allow an intuitive inclusion of T-category into the predictions. We will briefly summarize this HMM's formalism before building on it to include the contralateral spread in @sec-ext-to-contra.
-->

We represent a patient’s state of involvement at an abstract time-step $t$ as a vector of hidden binary random variables, where each component corresponds to a lymph node level (LNL):

$$
\mathbf{X}[t] = \begin{pmatrix} X_v[t] \end{pmatrix} \qquad v \in \left\{ 1, 2, \ldots, V \right\}
$$ {#eq-state-def}

Here, $V$ is the number of LNLs the model considers. The values a LNL's may take on are $X_v[t] = 0$ (`False`), meaning the LNL $v$ is healthy or free of metastatic disease, or $X_v[t] = 1$ (`True`), corresponding to some form of tumor presence (i.e., occult or macroscopic disease). In total, there are $2^V$ distinct possible lymphatic involvement patterns, which we enumerate from $\boldsymbol{\xi}_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ to $\boldsymbol{\xi}_{2^V} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \end{pmatrix}$. Each LNL's state is observed via another binary random variable $Z_v$ that describes the clinical involvement of a LNL based on imaging: $Z_v = 0$ (`False`) indicates that the LNL $v$ is healthy based on clinical diagnosis, and $Z_v = 1$ (`True`) indicates that LNL $v$ was classified as involved. $X_v$ and $Z_v$ are connected through the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnositc modality.

Based on this, our HMM is fully described by defining the following three quantities:

1. A starting state $\mathbf{X}[t=0]$ at time $t=0$ just before the patient's tumor formed. In our case, this is always the state $\boldsymbol{\xi}_0$ where all LNLs are still healthy.
2. The *transition matrix*
   $$
   \mathbf{A} = \left( A_{ij} \right) = \big( P \left( \mathbf{X}[t+1] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_j \mid \mathbf{X}[t] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_i \right) \big)
   $$ {#eq-trans-matrix}
   where the value at row $i$ and column $j$ represents the probability to transition from state $\boldsymbol{\xi}_i$ to $\boldsymbol{\xi}_j$ during the time-step from $t$ to $t+1$. Note that we prohibit self-healing, meaning that during a transition, no LNL may change their state from $X_v[t]=1$ to $X_v[t+1]=0$. Consequently, many elements of the transition matrix are zero.
3. Lastly, the *observation matrix*
   $$
   \mathbf{B} = \left( B_{ij} \right) = \big( P \left( \mathbf{Z} = \boldsymbol{\zeta}_j \mid \mathbf{X}[t_D] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_i \right) \big)
   $$ {#eq-obs-matrix}
   where in row $i$ and at column $j$ we find the probability to *observe* a lymphatic involvement pattern $\mathbf{Z} = \boldsymbol{\zeta}_j$, given that the true (but hidden) state of involvement at the time of diagnosis $t_D$ is $\mathbf{X}[t_D] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_i$.

The transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is parameterized using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the underlying lymphatic network. Edges from the primary tumor to an LNL are associated with a probability $b_v$ for direct spread to LNL $v$ during one time step. Arcs from a LNL $v$ to a LNL $r$ are parameterized with the probability rate $t_{vr}$ for inter-nodal progression. In this paper, we build on the DAG shown in @fig-full-graph which was obtained by maximizing the model evidence as described in [@ludwig_modelling_2024].

![Directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the abstract lymphatic network in the head and neck region. Blue nodes are the LNLs' hidden random variables, the red node represents the tumor, and the orange square nodes depict the binary observed variables. Red and blue arcs symbolize the probability of lymphatic spread along that edge during one time-step. The orange arcs represent the sensitivity and specificity of the observational modality (e.g. CT, MRI, pathology, ...).](static/full-graph.svg){#fig-full-graph width=40%}

We can evolve the distribution of all possible hidden states from $\mathbf{X}[t=0] = \boldsymbol{\xi}_0$ step by step, by successively multiplying this vector with the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$: $\mathbf{X}[t+1] = \mathbf{X}[t] \cdot \mathbf{A}$. For later use, we define at this point a matrix $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ that collects these distributions for all considered time-steps:

$$
\boldsymbol{\Lambda} = P \left( \mathbf{X} \mid \mathbf{t} \right) = \begin{pmatrix}
\boldsymbol{\pi}^\intercal \cdot \mathbf{A}^0 \\
\boldsymbol{\pi}^\intercal \cdot \mathbf{A}^1 \\
\vdots \\
\boldsymbol{\pi}^\intercal \cdot \mathbf{A}^{t_\text{max}} \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$ {#eq-lambda-matrix}

Where the $k$-th row in this matrix corresponds to the probability distribution over hidden states after $t=k-1$ time-steps.

At the time of diagnosis, $0 \leq t_D \leq t_\text{max}$, we multiply the evolved state distribution with the observation matrix $\mathbf{B}$ to obtain the distribution over all possible diagnoses. However, the exact time of diagnosis, $t_D$, is unknown; that is, we do not know the number of time-steps over which the HMM should be evolved. To address this, we marginalize over all possible diagnosis times, allowing the diagnosis to occur at any time-step, albeit with different weights. These weights are defined by a prior distribution over $t_D$, which can vary depending on the patient's T-category. For example, the time-prior for early T-category patients, $P(t_D \mid \text{early})$, may put more weight on earlier time-steps, reflecting -- on average -- earlier detection, compared to the prior for advanced T-category patients, $P(t_D \mid \text{advanced})$.

$$
P\left( \mathbf{X} \mid \text{T}x = \text{early} \right) = \sum_{t=0}^{t_\text{max}} P \left( \mathbf{X} \mid t \right) \cdot P(t \mid \text{early})
$$

In this work, we use binomial distributions $\mathfrak{B} \left( t_D, p_{\text{T}x} \right)$ as time-priors which have one free parameter $p_{\text{T}x}$ for each group of patients we differentiate based on T-category. Also, we fix $t_\text{max} = 10$, which means that the expected number of time-steps from the onset of a patient's disease to their diagnosis is $\mathbb{E}\left[ t_D \right] = 10 \cdot p_{\text{T}x}$.


## Likelihood Function of the Unilateral Model

The likelihood function for a patient to present with a diagnosis $\boldsymbol{\zeta}_i$ a T-category $\text{T}x$ tumor can now be written as:

$$
\ell = P \left( \mathbf{Z} = \boldsymbol{\zeta}_i \mid \text{T}x \right) = \sum_{t=0}^{t_\text{max}} \left[ \boldsymbol{\xi}_0 \cdot \mathbf{A}^t \cdot \mathbf{B} \right]_i \cdot P \left( t \mid \text{T}x \right)
$$ {#eq-single-patient-llh}

With $\left[ \ldots \right]_i$ we denote the $i$-th component of the vector in the square brackets. Note that it is also possible to account for missing involvement information: If a diagnosis (like fine needle aspiration (FNA)) is only available for a subset of all LNLs, we can sum over all those possible complete observed states $\boldsymbol{\zeta}_j$ that match the provided diagnosis.

The single-patient likelihood $\ell$ in @eq-single-patient-llh depends on the spread parameters shown in @fig-full-graph via the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and on the binomial parameters $p_{\text{T}x}$ via time-priors. In this work, we will only differentiate between "early" (T1 & T2) and "advanced" (T3 & T4) T-categories. Therefore, the parameter space of the unilateral model is:

$$
\boldsymbol{\theta} = \left( \left\{ b_v \right\}, \left\{ t_{vr} \right\}, p_\text{early}, p_\text{adv.} \right) \quad \text{with} \quad \genfrac{}{}{0pt}{2}{v\leq V}{r\in\operatorname{pa}(v)}
$$ {#eq-param-space}

And it is our goal to infer optimal parameter values of from a given dataset $\mathcal{D}$ (consisting of diagnoses and T-categories) of OPSCC patients. The likelihood to observe this cohort of $N$ patients, given a set of parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is simply the product of their individual likelihoods as defined in @eq-single-patient-llh. For numerical reasons, we typically compute the data likelihood in log space:

$$
\log \mathcal{L} \left( \mathcal{D} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta} \right) = \sum_{i=1}^N \log \ell_i
$$ {#eq-log-likelihood}

The methodology we use to infer the model's parameters is detailed in @sec-sampling.


# Extension to a Bilateral Model {#sec-ext-to-contra}

A straightforward approach to modeling contralateral lymphatic spread would be to use two independent unilateral models, as described in Section @sec-unilateral, with shared parameters such as the distribution of diagnosis times or spread between LNLs ($t_{vr}$). However, this method would fail to capture the correlation between ipsilateral and contralateral involvement discussed in @sec-data-strat, particularly the observed increase in contralateral involvement with greater severity of ipsilateral spread.

<!-- This is displayed in @tbl-data-strat and shows how often the contralateral LNLs I, II, III, and IV were involved, given all possible combinations of midline extension, T-category, and ipsilateral LNL III involvement. Unsurprisingly, the prevalence for contralateral involvement is consistently higher when the tumor extends over the mid-sagittal line or is of later T-category. But it is also more frequent when the ipsilateral side shows more severe involvement, which is here shown via the surrogate LNL III. -->

<!-- Additionally, we could think of an approach to incorporate the primary tumor's mid-sagittal extension as a risk factor. -->

Thus, we extend the formalism in @sec-unilateral in such a way that the model's ipsi- and contralateral side evolve synchronously over time. To achieve that, we start by writing down the posterior distribution of involvement in analogy to @eq-uni-bayes-law, which is now a joint probability of an involvement $\mathbf{X}^\text{i}$ ipsilaterally *and* an involvement $\mathbf{X}^\text{c}$ contralaterally, given a diagnosis of the ipsilateral LNLs $\mathbf{Z}^\text{i}$ and of the contralateral ones $\mathbf{Z}^\text{c}$:

$$
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \right) = \frac{P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right) P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right)}{P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \right)}
$$ {#eq-bilateral-bayes}

For the sake of brevity, we omit the dependency on the parameters and the T-category here.

The probability of the diagnoses given a hidden state factorises: $P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right) = P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i} \right) \cdot P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right)$, and the two factors are described through observation matrices $\mathbf{B}^\text{i}$ and $\mathbf{B}^\text{c}$.

The term representing the model's prior probability of hidden involvement does not factorize. However, we assume no direct lymphatic drainage from ipsilateral to contralateral LNLs, as major lymph vessels do not cross the mid-sagittal plane. In the graphical model, this translates to the absence of directed arcs between ipsilateral and contralateral LNLs, implying that contralateral tumor spread occurs solely via the primary tumor. We can thus write the joint probability $P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right)$ as a factorising sum:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right) &= \sum_{t=0}^{t_\text{max}} P(t) \cdot P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid t \right) \\
&= \sum_{t=0}^{t_\text{max}} P(t) \cdot P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i} \mid t \right) \cdot P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid t \right)
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-bilateral-marginal}

This assumption is intuitive: since no major lymph vessels cross the midline, the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the lymphatic network evolve independently over time. However, they are indirectly coupled through time. For example, a joint state with severe contralateral involvement and limited ipsilateral involvement is improbable: Severe contralateral involvement typically occurs at later time steps, when limited ipsilateral involvement is unlikely.

<!-- There may, however, be diffusion of lymph fluid accross this line or bulky involvement that redirects lymphatic drainage significantly.-->

Using @eq-bilateral-marginal along with @eq-lambda-matrix, we can write the above distribution algebraically as a product:

$$
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_n, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_m \right) = \left[ \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^\intercal_\text{i} \cdot \operatorname{diag} P(\mathbf{t}) \cdot \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_\text{c} \right]_{n,m}
$$ {#eq-bilateral-marginal-algebra}


## Parameter Symmetries {#sec-params-symmetry}

The matrices $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\text{i}$ and $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\text{c}$ could, in principle, be parameterized with entirely separate parameters, allowing ipsilateral and contralateral spread rates to differ completely. However, we simplify the parameter space by sharing parameters between the two sides, based on the following three assumptions:

1. **Shared Graph Structure**: Both ipsilateral and contralateral spread are described by the same graph shown in @fig-full-graph.
2. **Symmetric Spread Among LNLs**: The spread among LNLs is assumed to be the same on both sides, reflecting the symmetric structure of the lymphatic system. Consequently, the spread rates between nodes should also be symmetric. This is formalized as:\
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  b_v^\text{c} &\neq b_v^\text{i} \\
  t_{rv}^\text{c} &= t_{rv}^\text{i}
  \end{aligned}
  $$ {#eq-symmetries}
  for all $v \leq V$ and $r \in \operatorname{pa}(v)$.
3. **Asymmetric Spread from Tumor**: Tumor spread to the contralateral side varies depending on whether the tumor crosses the mid-sagittal plane. When the tumor extends over the midline, its spread rate to the contralateral LNLs should be larger than if the tumor were lateralized, but still smaller than the tumor's spread to the ipsilateral side. To model this, we introduce a mixing parameter $\alpha \in [0,1]$, representing the "degree of asymmetry" effectively mixing these two extremes:\
  $$
  b_v^{\text{c},\epsilon=\texttt{True}} = \alpha \cdot b_v^\text{i} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot b_v^{\text{c},\epsilon=\texttt{False}}
  $$ {#eq-mixing}
  This parameterization results in three sets of rates for tumor spread to the LNLs: (1) the spread to ipsilateral LNLs $b^\text{i}_v$, (2) the spread to contralateral LNLs as long as the tumor is lateralized $b_v^{\text{c},\epsilon=\texttt{False}}$, (3) the spread to contralateral LNLs when the tumor crosses the midline $b_v^{\text{c},\epsilon=\texttt{True}}$. Despite this additional complexity, these rates collectively account for only $2 \cdot 2^V + 1$ parameters due to their coupling via $\alpha$.

The parameter space now becomes:

$$
\boldsymbol{\theta} = \left( \left\{ b_v^\text{i} \right\}, \left\{ b_v^\text{c} \right\}, \alpha, \left\{ t_{vr} \right\}, p_\text{early}, p_\text{adv.} \right) \quad \text{with} \quad \genfrac{}{}{0pt}{2}{v\leq V}{r\in\operatorname{pa}(v)}
$$ {#eq-bi-param-space}

This results in less than a doubling of parameters compared to the unilateral model. From these parameters, we construct three transition matrices: the unchanged $\mathbf{A}_\text{i}$ for the ipsilateral side, $\mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{False}}$ for contralateral progression while the tumor is lateralized, and $\mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{True}}$ for cases where the tumor crosses the mid-sagittal plane.


## Modelling Midline Extension {#sec-midline}

Most tumors crossing the midline at the time of diagnosis likely began as lateralized tumors that grew over the midline at a later stage. As a result, the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{True}}$ applies only to a subset of time-steps.

To account for this, we model the tumor's extension over the mid-sagittal line as a binary random variable. A tumor starts as lateralized, with a finite probability $p_\epsilon$ at each time step of crossing the midline. The overall probabilities of a patient having a clearly lateralized tumor or one extending over the mid-sagittal line after $t$ time steps are then given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\epsilon = \texttt{False} \mid t) &= (1 - p_\epsilon)^t \\
P(\epsilon = \texttt{True} \mid t) &= 1 - P(\epsilon = \texttt{False} \mid t)
\end{aligned}
$$

Using this, it is straightforward to write down the matrix of state distributions for all time-steps, as in @eq-lambda-matrix covering the contralateral hidden state evolution:

$$
\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{False}} =
\left(
\begin{array}{r}
\boldsymbol{\pi}^\intercal \cdot \left( \mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{False}} \right)^{0\phantom{t_\text{max}}} \\
(1-p_\epsilon) \cdot \boldsymbol{\pi}^\intercal \cdot \left( \mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{False}} \right)^{1\phantom{t_\text{max}}} \\
\hfill \vdots \hfill \\
(1-p_\epsilon)^{t_\text{max}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\pi}^\intercal \cdot \left( \mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{False}} \right)^{t_\text{max}\phantom{0}} \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$

where we used the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{False}}$ that depends on the base spread parameters $b_v^{\text{c},\epsilon=\texttt{False}}$.

The case of midline extension is more complex: we already marginalize over the exact time step when the tumor grows over the mid-sagittal line. However, at the point of crossing, the contralateral transition matrix must switch to the increased spread rates, $b_v^{\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True}}$, as defined by the linear mixing in @eq-mixing. To correctly perform this marginalization, we iteratively construct the joint distribution $P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \mid t \right)$.

We begin at $t=0$, where all contralateral LNLs are healthy (i.e., $\mathbf{X}_\text{c}=\boldsymbol{\xi}_0$) and the tumor is lateralized ($\epsilon=\texttt{False}$):

$$
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_0, \epsilon=\texttt{False} \mid t=0 \right) = 1
$$

while all other states have zero probability.

At some later time step $t=\tau+1$, there are two scenarios to marginalize over:

1. **The tumor was lateralized at $t=\tau$ and grew over the midline at $t=\tau+1$:**  
   In this case, the probability of midline extension at $t=\tau+1$ is $p_\epsilon$. This probability weights the contralateral state distribution that had previously evolved without increased contralateral spread.

2. **The tumor had already crossed the midline before $t=\tau$:**  
   Here, the tumor remains in the midline-crossed state with probability 1. To account for this scenario, we simply include the distribution $P\left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \mid \tau \right)$ from the previous time step.

Combining these scenarios leads to a recursive formulation:


$$
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \mid \tau + 1 \right) = \big[ p_\epsilon P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{False} \mid \tau \right) + P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \mid \tau \right) \big]^\top \cdot \mathbf{A}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{True}}
$$

We can collect the iteratively computed distributions for the midline extension case to define the matrix over the states given all time-steps, in analogy to @eq-lambda-matrix:

$$
\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_\text{c}^{\epsilon=\texttt{True}} = \begin{pmatrix}
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \mid 0 \right) \\
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \mid 1 \right) \\
\vdots \\
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \mid t_\text{max} \right) \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Using this, we can again write the joint of ipsi- and contralateral involvement - now also for the case of mid-sagittal extension - algebraically as before in @eq-bilateral-marginal-algebra:

$$
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_n, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} = \boldsymbol{\xi}_m, \epsilon \right) = \left[ \boldsymbol{\Lambda}^\intercal_\text{i} \cdot \operatorname{diag} P(\mathbf{t}) \cdot \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_\text{c}^\epsilon \right]_{n,m}
$$

With the above, we compute the likelihood of all patients with and without midline extension separately. And if for some patients the information of tumor lateralization is not available, we can simply marginalize over the unknown variable $\epsilon \in \{ \texttt{False}, \texttt{True} \}$.

The final parameter space of our extended model has now reached this size:

$$
\boldsymbol{\theta} = \left( \left\{ b_v^\text{i} \right\}, \left\{ b_v^\text{c} \right\}, \alpha, \left\{ t_{vr} \right\}, p_\text{early}, p_\text{adv.}, p_\epsilon \right) \quad \text{with} \quad \genfrac{}{}{0pt}{2}{v\leq V}{r\in\operatorname{pa}(v)}
$$ {#eq-ext-param-space}


## Model Prediction in the Bayesian Context

Our stated goal is to compute the risk for a patient's true ipsi- and contralateral nodal involvement states $\mathbf{X}^\text{i}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\text{c}$, *given* their individual diagnosis $d = \left( \boldsymbol{\zeta}^\text{i}_k, \boldsymbol{\zeta}^\text{c}_\ell, \epsilon, \text{T}x \right)$. Here, this diagnosis consists of the observed ipsi- and contralateral nodal involvements, the patient's midline extension $\epsilon$, and their tumor's T-category $\text{T}x$. Using Bayes' law, we can write this risk as:

$$
P \big( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid d, \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}} \big)
= \frac{P \left( \boldsymbol{\zeta}^\text{i}_k \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i} \right) P \left( \boldsymbol{\zeta}^\text{c}_\ell \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right) P \big( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \mid \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}, \text{T}x \big)}
{\sum_{i=0}^{2^V} \sum_{j=0}^{2^V} \mathcal{C}_{ij}}
$$ {#eq-uni-bayes-law}

with the normalization constants

$$
\mathcal{C}_{ij} = P \left( \boldsymbol{\zeta}^\text{i}_k \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i}=\boldsymbol{\xi}^\text{i}_i \right) P \big( \boldsymbol{\zeta}^\text{c}_\ell \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{c}=\boldsymbol{\xi}^\text{c}_j \big) P \big( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}=\boldsymbol{\xi}^\text{i}_i, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}=\boldsymbol{\xi}^\text{c}_j, \epsilon \mid \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}, \text{T}x \big)
$$

The terms $P \left( \boldsymbol{\zeta}^\text{i}_k \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i} \right)$ and $P \left( \boldsymbol{\zeta}^\text{c}_\ell \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \right)$ are defined solely by sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic modality. Terms like these already appeared in the definition of the observation matrx in @eq-obs-matrix. The *prior* $P \big( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \mid \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}, \text{T}x \big)$ in the above equation is the crucial term that is supplied by a trained model and its parameters $\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}$.

It is possible to compute this *posterior* probability of true involvement not only for one fully defined state $(\mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c})$, but also for e.g. individual LNLs: For example, the risk for involvement in the contralateral level IV would be a marginalization over all ipsilateral states $\boldsymbol{\xi}^\text{i}_i$ and all contralateral states $\boldsymbol{\xi}^\text{c}_j$ where $\xi^\text{c}_{j4}=1$. Formally:

$$
P \big( \text{cIV} \mid \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}=\boldsymbol{\zeta}^\text{i}_k, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c}=\boldsymbol{\zeta}^\text{c}_\ell, \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}, \text{T}x \big) = \sum_k \sum_{\ell \, : \, \xi_{\ell 4}=1} P \big( \mathbf{X}^\text{i} = \boldsymbol{\xi}^\text{i}_k, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} = \boldsymbol{\xi}^\text{c}_\ell \mid \boldsymbol{\zeta}^\text{i}_k, \boldsymbol{\zeta}^\text{c}_\ell, \epsilon, \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}, \text{T}x \big)
$$ {#eq-marg-over-posterior}

## Involvement Data Consensus {#sec-methods-consensus}

Rather than providing the model with a patient's diagnoses from multiple modalities with different sensitivities and specificities (e.g. PET-CT *and* MRI), we combined them into a single "consensus" diagnosis before inference. This approach was necessary because literature-reported diagnostic imaging sensitivities and specificities did not plausibly match our observations. For instance, in the USZ cohort, 78% of OPSCC patients were diagnosed with ipsilateral LNL II involvement -— a finding difficult to reconcile with typical imaging sensitivities around 80% and specificities below 100% [@debondt_detection_2007;@kyzas_18ffluorodeoxyglucose_2008].

## MCMC Sampling {#sec-sampling}

We used the Python package [`emcee`] [@foreman-mackey_emcee_2013] for parameter inference, implementing efficient MCMC sampling with parallel affine-invariant samplers. The sampling algorithms employed differential evolution moves [@terbraak_differential_2008;@nelson_run_2013], with the likelihood implemented by our [`lymph-model`] Python package.

We initialized {{< var sampling.walkers_per_dim >}} parallel samplers ("walkers") with random values from the unit cube, effectively representing a uniform prior distribution over the model parameters. Convergence was determined by two criteria:

1. The change in autocorrelation time was less than {{< var sampling.rel_thresh >}}.
2. The autocorrelation estimate dropped below $n$ / {{< var sampling.trust_fac >}}, where $n$ is the chain length. Earlier autocorrelation estimates might not be trustworthy.

Samples from this *burn-in phase* before convergence were discarded. After that, we drew {{< var sampling.nsteps >}} additional samples, spaced {{< var sampling.thin >}} steps apart.

We verified sampling convergence in @fig-model-burnin-history by examining the MCMC chain's autocorrelation time and walker acceptance fractions.

## Computing the Observed and Predicted Prevalence of Involvement Patterns {#sec-prevalence}

We evaluate the model's ability to approximate the observed distribution of lymphatic involvement patterns. We compare the prevalence of selected involvement patterns in the data to the model's predicted prevalence, given patient scenarios.

A "scenario" includes the patient's T-category $\text{T}x$ and whether the tumor extended over the mid-sagittal line, i.e. $\epsilon=\texttt{True}$ or $\epsilon=\texttt{False}$. An involvement pattern specifies all ipsi- and contralateral LNLs' status as "healthy", "involved", or "masked" (ignored). 

For example, we may assess contralateral LNL II involvement prevalence under early T-category (T0-T2) and no midline extension ($\epsilon=\texttt{False}$). In the data, {{< var data.early_nomidext_cII_total >}} such patients were observed, with {{< var data.early_nomidext_cII_match >}} exhibiting contralateral LNL II involvement -- a prevalence of {{< var data.early_nomidext_cII_percent >}}%.

To visualize the data prevalence, we plot a *beta posterior* over the true prevalence $q$. It is the result of a uniform beta prior over $q$, multiplied with the binomial likelihood for $k$ out of $n$ patients, given $q$. The resulting distribution has its maximum at $q=k / n$ and nicely captures the uncertainty in the observed cohort: if only 3 out of 10 patients are observed with a specific pattern, the distribution is much wider than if we observe 300 out of 1000.

The model's predicted prevalence to compare it with is computed as:

$$
P \left( \text{II}^\text{c} \mid \epsilon=\texttt{False}, \text{T}x=\text{early} \right) = \frac{P \left( \text{II}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{False} \mid \text{T}x=\text{early} \right)}{P \left( \epsilon=\texttt{False} \mid \text{T}x=\text{early} \right)}
$$

In the enumator, we marginalize over all ipsi- and contralateral LNLs' involvements, except for LNL II contralaterally. This is similar to the marginalization in @eq-marg-over-posterior, although we are summing over different quantities. In the denominator, we can simply insert the joint distribution over midline extension and diagnose time $P \left( \epsilon, t \right)$ marginalized over $t$ using the early T-category's time-prior.

We display model predictions as histograms, each value computed from one of the MCMC samples. Ideally, these approximate the location and width of the beta posteriors from the data showing an accurate and precise fit.

Note that we omit the y-axis in these figures, as their numerical value is not intuitively interpretable. We instead use the free space to label e.g. rows in an array of subplots.


# Results: Model evaluation {#sec-results}

In @tbl-midline-params, we tabulate the mean and standard deviation of the sampled parameters. The bilateral model mostly reproduces the ipsilateral spread parameter values reported in the earlier publication on the unilateral model [@ludwig_modelling_2023]. Any discrepancies may be due to differences in the patient cohorts. Therefore, we omit the analysis of the ipsilateral spread patterns and focus instead on the analysis of contralateral involvement. Lastly, note the relatively small contralateral spread parameters $b^c_v$ compared to the ipsilateral parameters $b^i_v$. This accurately reflects the low prevalence of contralateral lymph node involvement for lateralized tumors.

## Illustration of the model

In this subsection, we illustrate key aspects of the mathematical framework introduced earlier. The top panel of @fig-model-midext-evo shows the prior distribution over diagnosis times, $P(t)$. Based on the parameterization, early T-category tumors are on average diagnosed after {{< var model.early_expected_time >}} time steps, while advanced T-category tumors are diagnosed later, averaging {{< var model.late_expected_time >}} time steps. This is due to the learned value of $p_\text{adv.}$, which is {{< var model.params_percent.late_p >}}% for advanced T-category tumors. The tumor's average probability per time step of growing over the midline, $p_\epsilon$, was found to be {{< var model.params_percent.midext_prob >}}%. Using this value, the conditional probability of midline extension, $P(\epsilon \mid t)$, can be computed for a given time step $t$ (red line in the top panel of @fig-model-midext-evo). The bottom panel visualizes the joint probability $P(\epsilon, t)$, showing the likelihood of diagnosis at time $t$ with specific states of midline extension and T-category.

![The top panel shows the prior probability to be diagnosed at time step $t$ for early and late T-category tumors as bars. The conditional probability of midline extension ($\epsilon=\texttt{True}$) given time step $t$ is shown as a line plot. The bottom panel illustrates the joint probability of being diagnosed at time $t$ and having a tumor that crosses the midline.](figures/fig_model_midext_evo.svg){#fig-model-midext-evo width="50%"}

The framework models the joint probability distribution of midline extension and ipsi- and contralateral lymph node involvement, $P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right)$. This is visualized in @fig-model-algebra-equation, which represents the calculation defined in @eq-bilateral-marginal-algebra. To simplify interpretation, the example focuses only on LNLs II, III, and IV, reducing the state space to $2^3 = 16$ possible states per side, and $2 \times 8 \times 8 = 128$ total states. LNLs I, V, and VII are excluded, along with their spread parameters, while remaining parameters are set to their mean values from @tbl-midline-params.

![Visual representation of @eq-bilateral-marginal-algebra for midline extension. The left and right matrices represent the time evolution of hidden states for the ipsi- and contralateral necks, respectively. The right matrices distinguish between the cases of no midline extension (top) and midline extension (bottom). The central diagonal matrix shows the time-prior for late T-category tumors. This computation yields the joint distribution $P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right)$, visualized in @fig-model-state-dist.](figures/fig_model_algebra_equation.svg){#fig-model-algebra-equation}

The left matrix in @fig-model-algebra-equation shows the time evolution of the probability distribution over the ipsilateral involvement states, starting from the healthy state $[0,0,0]$. The two right matrices show the contralateral state evolution, distinguishing between the cases of midline extension and no midline extension. At $t=0$, the contralateral neck begins in the healthy state $[0,0,0]$ without midline extension. The central matrix shows the time prior for late T-category tumors. The matrix multiplication results in the joint distribution $P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon=\texttt{True} \right)$, visualized in @fig-model-state-dist.

This joint distribution is presented as two heatmaps, corresponding to the two states of midline extension. The most likely state involves a lateralized tumor with ipsilateral level II involvement and no contralateral involvement, having a probability of approximately 25%. The next most probable state involves ipsilateral levels II and III without contralateral involvement. The most likely state with contralateral involvement corresponds to tumors with midline extension, showing involvement of contralateral level II and ipsilateral levels II and III.

## Prevalence predictions for contralateral involvement

The bilateral model was designed to meet the requirements outlined in @sec-requirements. Here, we evaluate the model's ability to quantitatively capture the observed patterns of lymph node involvement in the dataset. Specifically, we compare the model's predictions for contralateral involvement to the observed data across scenarios that vary by T-category, midline extension, and ipsilateral involvement.

### Dependence of Contralateral Involvement on T-Category and Midline Extension

In @fig-model-prevalences-overall, we compare the prevalence of contralateral involvement for LNLs II, III, and IV across four scenarios: combinations of early and late T-category, and lateralized versus midline-extending tumors.

![Comparison of predicted (histograms) vs observed (beta posteriors) prevalences, shown for the contralateral LNLs II (blue), III (orange), and IV (green). The top row shows scenarios with early T-category tumors, the bottom row for late T-category ones. The left column depicts scenarios where the primary tumor is clearly lateralized, the right column scenarios of tumors extending over the mid-sagittal line. This figure illustrates the model's ability to describe the prevalence of involvement for different combinations of the risk factors T-category and midline extension.](figures/fig_model_prevalences_overall.svg){#fig-model-prevalences-overall}

@Fig-model-prevalences-overall demonstrates the model's ability to account for key risk factors, such as T-category and midline extension. Consistent with the data, the model predicts that the prevalence of contralateral LNL II involvement increases from {{< var prevalence.early_noext_iN0_cII.predicted >}}% for early T-category lateralized tumors to {{< var prevalence.late_ext_iN0_cII.predicted >}}% for advanced T-category tumors that cross the midline. Similarly, contralateral LNL III involvement rises from around {{< var prevalence.early_noext_iN0_cIII.predicted >}}% for early T-category lateralized tumors to nearly {{< var prevalence.late_ext_iN0_cIII.predicted >}}% for advanced T-category midline-extending tumors.

### Influence of Upstream Involvement on Contralateral Metastasis

![The influence of the upstream LNL II's involvement on the prevalence of contralateral level III for the four combinations of tumor lateralization (lateralized or extending over midline) and T-category (early or advanced). Our model predictions (histograms) are plotted against the observations in the data (beta posteriors).](figures/fig_model_prevalences_upstream.svg){#fig-model-prevalences-upstream}

@Fig-model-prevalences-upstream highlights the influence of upstream LNL II involvement on contralateral LNL III metastasis. The contralateral LNL III rarely harbors metastases when its upstream LNL II is healthy, a correlation well-captured by the model. However, for early T-category tumors extending over the midline, the model slightly underestimates the observed prevalence, likely due to the relative rarity of such cases, resulting in broader uncertainty in the observed prevalence estimates.

### Correlation between Ipsi- and Contralateral Involvement

![Comparison of the computed and observed prevalences for scenarios that illustrate the model's capability of accounting for the correlation between ipsi- and contralateral involvement. We show three scenarios where we consider the joint involvement of contralateral LNL II together with different ipsilateral involvements: 1) the ipsilateral neck shows no involvement in blue (LNLs I to V are healthy, LNL VII is unspecified because data on it is missing for some patients), 2) where ipsilateral LNL II is involved in orange (LNLs I, III, IV, and V are healthy), and 3) where ipsilateral LNLs II and III are involved in orange (LNLs I, IV, and V are healthy). These two scenarios are plotted for all combinations of T-category (early in top row, advanced in bottom row) and tumor lateralization (lateralized in left column, extending over mid-sagittal line in the right column).](figures/fig_model_prevalences_with_ipsi.svg){#fig-model-prevalences-with-ipsi}

In @fig-model-prevalences-with-ipsi, the model's ability to capture the correlation between ipsi- and contralateral involvement is demonstrated. The marginals of the joint distribution highlight contralateral LNL II involvement alongside varying ipsilateral LNL involvement states. Despite having no direct connections between the two sides, the model successfully predicts these correlations, which arise purely through the shared diagnosis time. 

For example, the model accurately predicts that contralateral LNL II involvement is rare when the ipsilateral neck is completely healthy (green histograms). However, if ipsilateral LNL II is involved, contralateral involvement becomes more likely. Notably, the model achieves this without specific parameters to quantify ipsi-contralateral correlations, relying instead on the inherent structure of the time-dependent dynamics.


# Results: Prediction of Risk for Occult Disease {#sec-results-risk}

For a clinical application of the model we are interested in the risk of occult metastases rather than the observed patterns of lymph node involvement. We want to estimate the risk for occult disease in clinically negative LNLs, given the patient's individual diagnosis. In terms of our model, the diagnosis consists of the T-category, the lateralization of the tumor (if it extend over the mid-sagittal plane), and which LNLs are clinically involved based on imaging and possibly fine needle aspiration (FNA). For the results shown in this section, we assume that involvement of a LNL is clinically diagnosed through imaging with a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 76% [@debondt_detection_2007]. For FNA we assume a specificity of 98% and a sensitivity of 80%. This amounts to the assumption that lymph node involvement confirmed by FNA is almost certainly true involvement, i.e. there are almost no false positive diagnoses.

## Contralateral LNL II

@Fig-model-risks (left panel) shows the predicted risk of occult disease in contralateral LNL II. The most important variable impacting the prediction for contralateral level II involvement in our model is the tumor's lateralization. A patient with a clearly lateralized early T-category tumor and clinically detected metastases in ipsilateral LNL II is predicted to have a 1-2% <!-- TODO: make this dynamic --> risk for occult disease in contralateral LNL II (green histogram). For a cN0 patient with a clearly lateralized early T-category tumor but *with* mid-sagittal extension, the risk increases to {{< var risk.early_ext_iN0_cN0_II >}}% (orange histogram).

Also advanced T-category increases the risk of occult disease but plays a lesser role. Considering the scenario of an early T-category tumor that crosses the midline and an ipsilateral neck where the LNLs II and III are clinically involved, the risk for occult contralateral LNL II disease is around {{< var risk.early_ext_iII+III_cN0_II >}}% (red histogram). For the same scenario and an advanced T-category tumor, the risk increases to {{< var risk.late_ext_iII+III_cN0_II >}}% (purple histogram).

Lastly, the predicted risk of occult contralateral LNL II involvement also increases with the degree of ipsilateral involvement. When an early T-category patient with a tumor that extends over the mid-sagittal line presents with a clinically N0 ipsilateral neck instead of involvement in the levels II and III, the risk is {{< var risk.early_ext_iN0_cN0_II >}}% instead of {{< var risk.early_ext_iII+III_cN0_II >}}%.

Taken together, for lateralized tumors, the risk of occult contralateral involvement remains low even for patients with advanced T-category tumors and ipsilateral involvement of LNLs II and III (blue histogram), making midline extension the main risk factor. However, advanced T-category and severe ipsilateral involvement may still considerably increase the predicted risk for contralateral involvement. 


## Contralalteral LNL III

As shown in the center subplot of @fig-model-risks, the risk for occult disease in the contralateral LNL III may only cross a 5% threshold if the upstream level II is clinically involved. Even for advanced T-category tumors extending over the midline with extensive ipsilateral involvement (green histogram), the risk of occult metastases in contralateral LNL III is only 2% <!-- TODO: make this dynamic --> if the upstream LNL II is clinically negative. For an advanced T-category tumors extending over the midline with clinical involvement of both ispilateral and contralateral LNL II involvement, the predicted risk in contralateral LNL III increases to 4-5% <!-- TODO: make this dynamic --> (blue histogram). If the clinical diagnosis of the contralateral upstream level II is pathologically confirmed by FNA the risk increases to {{< var risk.late_ext_iII_cII_FNA_III >}}% (red histogram). This is because the possibility that the clinical involvement in contralateral LNL II is a false positive diagnoses is almost excluded. If contralateral LNL II is involved, the predicted risk in contralateral LNL III is {{< var risk.late_noext_iII_cII_FNA_III >}}% even for lateralized tumors (orange histogram).

## Contralateral LNL IV

Our model's prediction for the risk in contralateral LNL IV is below 1% <!-- TODO: make this dynamic --> if the upstream LNL III is clinically negative, that even in the most extreme case of an advanced T-category tumor extending over the mid-sagittal line with metastases in the ipsilateral LNLs II-IV and the contralateral level II (green histogram). If additionally contralateral LNL III is clinically involved, the risk increases to {{< var risk.late_ext_iII+III+IV_cII+III_IV >}}% (blue histogram). Only when the involvement of the upstream level III is pathologically confirmed using FNA, we predict a substantially higher risk of {{< var risk.late_ext_iII+III+IV_cII+III_FNA_IV >}}% (orange histogram). This is because the prior probability for contralateral LNL III and IV involvement is so low that, even given a clinically positive diagnosis in LNL III, it is likely that the involvement in LNL III is a false possitive diagnosis both LNLs III and IV are negative. This possibility, however, is virtually excluded when the involvement in contralateral level III is confirmed by FNA.


## Contralateral LNLs I, V, and VII

Even for advanced T-category patients whose tumor crosses the midline and who present with extensive ipsi- and contralateral clinical involvement, the risk for involvement in the LNLs I and VII never exceeds 3%. Contralateral LNL V also shows only a very low risk for occult disease. Only in the extreme case of severe contralateral involvement including LNL IV, confirmed by FNA, the predicted risk is {{< var risk.late_ext_iI+II+III+IV+V+VII_cII+III+IV_FNA_V >}}%.


# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Summary

In this work we present a formalism to model the ipsi- and contralateral lymph node involvement in oropharyngeal SCC patients. An ipsilateral model has been previously developed and published [@ludwig_hidden_2021;@ludwig_modelling_2023]. Based on this, we introduce an extension that leaves the ipsilateral model unchanged, but extends it to the contralateral side in an intuitive and comprehensible manner. The model parameters are learned from a dataset of {{< var data.num_patients >}} patients from four institutions in whom ipsilateral and contralateral involvement was reported per per patient and LNL. The model takes the clincally diagnosed involvement of the LNLs and the primary tumor's T-category and lateralization into account when predicting the personalized risk for occult disease in any LNL of interest. Owing to the relatively few parameters, the model is highly interpretable and every parameter can be intuitively explained, while still being able to accurately describe the data on both ipsilateral and contralateral nodal involvement observed in the dataset.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive and detailed model of lymphatic tumor progression in oropharyngeal SCC available. The underlying data as well as the code is publicly available. While there was work on regional tumor spread, these models were conceptually different, more limited in the LNLs for which they make predictions, and not trained with real patient data [@benson_markov_2006;@jung_development_2017].


## Implications for Contralateral Elective Nodal Treatment

The predictions of this model are being used to inform a clinical trial on volume deescalation at the University Hospital Zurich [@universityofzurich_personalized_2024]. When accepting a 5% risk of occult disease in any given LNL, the model suggests the following contralateral elective irradiation (assuming the respective LNL is clinically healthy):

- For patients with lateralized tumors and without clinical involvement of contralateral LNLs, unilateral radiotherapy is performed. No contralateral LNLs are electively irradiated, irrespective of T-category and ipsilateral involvement.
- For patients without clinical involvement of contralateral LNLs but with tumors extending over the midline, only LNL II is electively irradiated. 
- LNL III is irradiated when LNL II is involved, irrespective of lateralization, T-category, and ipsilateral involvement. When the upstream LNL II is clinically negative, LNL III is not irradiated, except for the unlikely situation that contralateral LNL IV is involved.
- Irradiate LNL IV only when the upstream level III is confirmed to be involved.
- LNL V is not electively irradiated in most patients. Only in the most extreme cases, i.e., for advanced T-category tumors with midline extension and confirmed involvement of contralateral LNLs II to IV, LNL V may be irradiated.
- LNLs I and VII are not irradiated unless clinically involved.

In essence, this is a summary of the results in @sec-results-risk. However, it should be considered in light of the limitations outlined in @sec-discussion-limitations below.


## Limitations and Future Work {#sec-discussion-limitations}

### T-Category Dependence

The model has only one parameter, $p_\text{adv.}$, to describe differences in the patterns of involvement between early and advanced T-category. Higher involvement for advanced T-category is described by evolving the state of involvement overr a larger number of time-steps, while the probability of spread per time step, here the $b_v$ parameters, remains constant. Overall, the model captures the differences between early and advanced T-category very well as seen in @Fig-model-prevalences-overall. However, for some situations the observed difference between early vs advanced T-category in the data is greater or smaller than what our model predicts. This has previously been discussed for the involvement of ipsilateral LNL I [@ludwig_modelling_2023]. In the context of contralateral spread, the prevalence of midline extension is overestimated for early T-category tumors and underestimated for advanced T-category tumors, which is further discussed in @sec-prevalence-midext.


### Sensitivity and Specificity

As discussed in @sec-methods-consensus (and in more detail in @sec-consensus), we assumed for model training that the consensus across all diagnostic modalities represents the true state $X_v$ of lymph node involvement. This is appropriate for pathologically confirmed involvement but is an approximation for clinically diagnosed involvement, as the latter is - by definition - incapable of detecting occult disease. In principle, the model can be trained while  differentiating between pathologically confirmed and clinically diagnosed involvement, using a lower sensitivity and specificity for clinical diagnosis. This was not done here for two reasons: 1) this simplification allowed us to compare the observed prevalence of involvement to the model's prediction, and thereby investigate the model's capability to describe data with few interpretable parameters; and 2) the literature values for sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic modalities are inconsistent with some aspects of the observed data. Future work may aim at developing novel concepts to rigorously differentiating between pathologically confirmed and clinically diagnosed involvement. 

### Tumor Subsites

Within the cohort of patients with oropharyngeal tumors, subgroups can be identified whose tumors are located in different subsites, e.g. at the base of the tongue or on the tonsils. The lymphatic metastatic spread patterns of these subgroups may differ slightly. If so, the model could benefit from more fine-grained information about the precise tumor subsite for its training and prediction. We have conducted preliminary work to show that a mixture model may be a promising approach to capture the subsite specific spread patterns [@_proceedings_2024, @zora231470]. The additionally represents an approach to extend the model towards tumor locations in the oral cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx.

# Consensus on most likely involvement {#sec-consensus .appendix}

The consensus on the most likely involvement state of a LNL was formed as follows: Suppose the involvement status $X_v$ of LNL $v$ was assessed using different diagnostic modalities $\mathcal{O} = \{ \text{MRI}, \text{CT}, \text{pathology}, \ldots \}$, each characterized by their own pair of sensitivity and specificity values $s_N^{\mathcal{o}}$ and $s_P^{\mathcal{o}}$, with $\mathcal{o} \in \mathcal{O}$. These values are tabulated in @tbl-spec-sens. Then we have $|\mathcal{O}|$ observations $z_v^{\mathcal{o}} \in \left[ 0, 1 \right]$, where 0 stands for "healthy" and 1 for "involved". We can then compute the most likely true involvement $X_v$ using the likelihood function

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell \left( X_v \mid \{ z_v^{\mathcal{o}} \}_{\mathcal{o} \in \mathcal{O}} \right) = \prod_{\mathcal{o} \in \mathcal{O}}
\left( 1 - X_v \right) \cdot &\left[ z_v^{\mathcal{o}} \cdot \left( 1 - s_P^{\mathcal{o}} \right) + \left( 1 - z_v^{\mathcal{o}} \right) \cdot s_P^{\mathcal{o}} \right] \\
+ X_v \cdot &\left[ z_v^{\mathcal{o}} \cdot s_N^{\mathcal{o}} + \left( 1 - z_v^{\mathcal{o}} \right) \cdot (1 - s_N^{\mathcal{o}}) \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

We now assume the true state $X_v$ to take on the value 1 if $\ell \left( X_v = 1 \mid \ldots \right) > \ell \left( X_v = 0 \mid \ldots \right)$ and 0 otherwise. For example, if we have $z_\text{II}^\text{CT} = 0$ and $z_\text{II}^\text{MRI} = 1$ we would compute the following likelihoods:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell \left( X_\text{II} = 1 \mid z_\text{II}^\text{CT} = 0, z_\text{II}^\text{MRI} = 1 \right) &= \left( 1 - s_N^\text{CT} \right) \cdot s_N^\text{MRI} = 15.39\% \\
\ell \left( X_\text{II} = 0 \mid z_\text{II}^\text{CT} = 0, z_\text{II}^\text{MRI} = 1 \right) &= s_P^\text{CT} \cdot \left(1 - s_N^\text{MRI}\right) = 14.44\%
\end{aligned}
$$

In this example, we would thus assume the true state to be involved ($X_\text{II} = 1$).

This method of computing a consensus also ensures that the pathology reports always override any conflicting clinical diagnosis, due to pathology's high sensitivity and specificity.

| Modality  | Specificity | Sensitivity |
| :-------- | ----------: | ----------: |
| CT        |         76% |         81% |
| PET       |         86% |         79% |
| MRI       |         63% |         81% |
| FNA       |         98% |         80% |
| pathology |        100% |        100% |

# Prevalence of Midline Extension {#sec-prevalence-midext .appendix}

<!-- I moved this here, because we think this is probably irrelevant or distracting w.r.t. the main findings of the paper. But I do think it is somewhat interesting. -->

![Comparing the predicted (histograms) and observed (lines depicting beta posteriors) prevalence of midline extension for early (blue) and late (orange) T-category. While the prevalence is predicted correctly when marginalizing over T-category, the model cannot capture the degree of separation observed in the data. Since the tumor's midline extension is virtually always part of the diagnosis and hence *given* when predicting a patient's risk, we do not consider this discrepancy a major issue.](figures/fig_model_prevalences_midext.svg){#fig-model-prevalences-midext width="50%"}

In @fig-model-prevalences-midext, we plot the prevalence of midline extension in the data versus our model's prediction. It is obvious the model cannot match the large spread between early and advanced T-category seen in the data. This is because to achieve that, it would need to increase the advanced T-category patient's prior distribution over diagnosis times and at the same time reduce the probability of the tumor to cross the midline during a time-step. But since the time-priors parameter is also coupled with the spread probabilities among the LNLs, the model does not have that freedom.

<!-- Should the paragraphs below be part of the discussion? -->

However, we do not consider this discrepancy a major limitation of the model: We will not realistically be interested in the probability of midline extension, as it is always possible to assess it with high certainty. That is also the reason why we initially modelled the midline extension *not* as a random variable, but as a global risk factor that would have been turned on or off from the onset of a patient's disease evolution. This, however, lead to overly high risks for contralateral involvement in advanced T-category patients with midline extension, because then the model assumes an increased spread to the contralateral side from the onset of the disease. Which is probably not true in a majority of those cases. Thus, treating it as a random variable that only becomes true during a patient's disease evolution resulted in a better description of the data.

Formally, the wrong prediction of midline extension prevalence makes little difference, since it is always given: Instead of $P\left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \mid \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \right)$, we typically compute $P\left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right)$, which does not suffer from the wrong probability of midline extension, as the distribution over hidden states is renormalized:

$$
P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right) = \frac{P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c} \mid \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right) P \left( \mathbf{X}^\text{i}, \mathbf{X}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right)}{P \left( \mathbf{Z}^\text{i}, \mathbf{Z}^\text{c}, \epsilon \right)}
$$

Note that a distribution over $\epsilon$ appears both in the enumerator and the denominator, which largely cancel each other, leaving only the midline extension's effect on the distribution over hidden states in the prediction.

Also, the discrepancy in midline extension prevalence between early and advanced T-category is particularly pronounced in oropharyngeal SCC patients. For example, in oral cavity SCC, the midline extension only increases from 15.4% (20 out of 130) to 33.3% (13 out of 39).
